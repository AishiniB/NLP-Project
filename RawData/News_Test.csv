In its FIR filed on Wednesday after a detailed preliminary enquiry in the matter, the CBI booked Adani Enterprises Ltd, the then NCCF chairman Virender Singh, the then managing director G P Gupta and senior advisor SC Singhal under IPC sections related to alleged criminal conspiracy, cheating under Indian Penal Code and Provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act, they said.  The Adani Group said the matter is an old one and it was a preliminary investigation report only.  &amp;quot;There is a news item about lodging of an FIR by CBI against National Cooperative Consumer Federation and Adani Enterprises Ltd. related to supply of imported coal. The subject matter is an old one. Adani Enterprises Ltd. has complied with the process, all formalities and relevant laws for the subject supply of coal. The company has not done anything wrong in supply of coal,&amp;quot; a statement quoted Adani spokesperson as saying. The spokesperson said it was a preliminary investigation report only.ï¿½  &amp;quot;The company shall respond to the same and shall also put forth the factual position to the authority,&amp;quot; the statement said. It is alleged that the NCCF officers &amp;quot;committed irregularities by manipulating the selection of the bidders, thereby giving undue favour to Adani Enterprises Ltd. in award of work for supply of imported coal to APGENCO despite its disqualification.  APGENCO had floated a limited tender enquiry on June 29, 2010 for the supply of six lakh MTs of imported coal via sea ports to Narla Tata Rao Thermal Power Plant in Vijaywada and Rayalaseema Thermal Power Plant (RTPP) in Kadapa free-on-rail basis via ports of Chennai, Vizag, Krishnapatnam and Kakinada, they said.  NCCF, which was one of the PSUs approached by APGENCO, had shortlisted six companies for the contract through a tender issued on July 7, 2010 cancelling the bid of a company Maharishi Brothers Coal Limited (MBCL) selected just six days before without any tendering process, the FIR alleged.  The argument given for the selection of MBCL was the close deadline of July 7, 2010 by APGENCO which was later extended to July 12.  &amp;quot;It is pertinent to mention here that before extension of the date of tender they had seven days (July 01, 2010 to July 07.2010) and after extension of date they had five days only (July 08 to July 12, 2010) but now management felt that they have sufficient time to call open tender,&amp;quot; the CBI FIR alleged. The draft tender notice on July 7 was discussed and approved by three senior officials of NCCF -- Singhal, Gupta, and Singh -- who ignored laid-down guidelines without consulting the Head Office level committee, it alleged.  The agency has alleged that during the tendering process, the officials favoured Adani Enterprises Ltd even though it had not given any trading margin for NCCF in contrast to two bidders Gupta Coal India and MBCL who had quoted much higher margins of 11.3 per cent and 2.25 per cent respectively, they said.  The CBI alleged that acts of &amp;quot;omission and commission&amp;quot; by the NCCF officers disclose that they acted in &amp;quot;a manner as unbecoming of public servants&amp;quot; and conspired with the company.  The FIR said the officers &amp;quot;committed irregularities by the way of manipulation in the selection of the bidders, thereby giving undue favour to Adani Enterprises in award of work for supply of imported coal to APGENCO despite its disqualification&amp;quot;.  The CBI has alleged that senior officers of NCCF did post tender negotiations with Adani Enterprises to give it undue benefits even though the company did not qualify when tender was opened at Hyderabad office of NCCF, the officials said.  &amp;quot;Instead of cancelling the bid of Adani Enterprises Ltd. senior management of NCCF conveyed the offer margin of NCCF to the company through one of its representatives Munish Sehgal who was sitting in the NCCF head office on July 10, 2010 in the evening...,&amp;quot; the FIR alleged.  It said subsequently Adani Enterprises Ltd on the same day informed NCCF that they agree to pay minimum margin charge of 2.25 per cent to NCCF.  &amp;quot;It is prima facie evident that when the bids were being processed at NCCF HO. New Delhi. representative of Adani Enterprises was Informed regarding their imminent rejection due to non submission of NCCF margin and also that MBCL, the eligible bidder had quoted 2 25 per cent margin,&amp;quot; the FIR alleged.  The agency has also alleged that Vyom Trade Links was a proxy of Adani Enterprises which had given it an unsecured loan of Rs 16.81 crore and withdrew its offer at last stage on &amp;quot;flimsy grounds&amp;quot;","Adani Enterprises, Business, CBI, India, Market news","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/cbi-books-adani-enterprises-3-ex-nccf-officials-for-alleged-irregularitiescoal-supply-contract_13365841.html

","The government's proposal to shift dividend distribution tax in the hands of investors will negatively impact NHAI and PowerGrid plans to raise funds through InvIT as higher tax incidence will make the instrument less attractive, rating agency Icra said.  In the Union Budget announced on February 1, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed removal dividend distribution tax (DDT), which will make dividend income from shares and mutual funds taxable in the hands of the unit-holder &mdash; instead of the company &mdash; at applicable income tax rates.  As per media reports, NHAI plans to initially raise Rs 15,000-20,000 crore and scale it up to Rs 40,000 crore later through monetisation of road assets, while PowerGrid Corporation has plans to monetise transmission assets of Rs 10,000 crore.  &amp;quot;As many as Rs 80,000 crore worth of InvITs were expected to be launched in 2020 of the Rs 2 trillion worth estimated in the next five years. However, the higher tax incidence in the hands of the unitholders will result in lower net-yield and reduced equity IRR, making equity raising a challenge,&amp;quot; Icra Senior Vice-President Shubham Jain told reporters.  InvITs have been an attractive vehicle for developers to unlock capital deployed in operational projects and helps in reducing the cost of debt for infrastructure projects, he said.  &amp;quot;Also, foreign institutional investors find InvITs attractive due to their stable long-term returns, relatively lower risks because of operational portfolio and better corporate governance. If InvITs have to succeed, a conducive regime is the key and much would depend on regulatory and tax regime,&amp;quot; Jain added.  According to Icra, domestic unit holders are likely to witness 34 per cent drop in returns, while foreign investors will witness around 22 per cent decline in returns.  Till date, Rs 22,000 crore have been raised from investors through InvITs, while another Rs 32,500 crore is in advanced stages.  Tower Infrastructure of Reliance Jio, a second InvIT from IRB&ndash;privately placed with GIC and acquisition of eight road assets by L&amp;amp;amp;T's IndInfravit from Sadbhav are the ones in advanced stages.  Jain further said the Budget has also proposed full tax exemption to sovereign wealth funds, which could support higher participation from sovereign funds.  &amp;quot;Also, the amendment in definition of Business Trusts made to include unlisted private placed InvITs will lead to tax parity between unlisted and listed private placed InvITs resulting in former likely to gain prominence due to lower compliance cost,&amp;quot; he added.","Business, NHAI, Power Grid","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/govt-proposalddt-to-adversely-impact-fund-raising-plansnhai-powergrid_13485221.html

9,2020-03-05 07:15:50+05:30,Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd.,APOLLOHOSP,"Hot Stocks | Why Apollo Hospitals, Alembic Pharma are short-term buys",Nifty on March 4 slid almost 200 points during the day but witnessed a sharp recovery in the second half of the session.,"  Rohan Patil  Since the gap down opening on Feb 28, the benchmark index Nifty has continued to trade below its 'continuation gap' and is looking weak at the current juncture.  In the last three out of four trading days, despite a gap-up opening, the Indian benchmark index could not hold on to the gains and witnessed negative closing with long red candles. This structure indicates bears are dominating bulls.  Nifty on March 4 slid almost 200 points during the day but witnessed a sharp recovery in the second half of the session.  For the time being, the index has managed to close above the 100-week exponential moving average on the weekly chart, but on the daily chart, there is an altogether different story as Indian bourses are nicely settled below their medium and long-term exponential moving averages.  The contagious nature of coronavirus is more concerning, and it would be difficult to predict a bottom, but at the same time, a bounce-back would also be equally fierce.  The overall market at the current stage is reacting sharply to coronavirus as it increases the fear of global slowdown.  So, prices are not respecting any technical and fundamentals levels at this juncture. But, this situation will be short-lived and the market will resume to normal soon.  As long as the index trades below 11,550, the probability of retesting the lows of 10,800 remains high. Some reliefs for bulls can be expected on a close above 11,550. For the time being, it looks prudent on the part of the traders to refrain from creating directional bets on the index.  Here are three stock recommendations for the next 3-4 weeks:  Apollo Hospitals Enterprise | Buy | LTP: Rs 1,753.05 | Target: Rs 1,850 | Stop loss: Rs 1,700 | Upside: 5.53%  Since the last week of July 2019, Apollo Hospitals is trading in a higher high higher bottom formation on the weekly time frame.  Since the first week of January 2020, the stock is outperforming the benchmark index on the week-on-week basis on Relative Strength (RS).  In the current bearish scenario, the stock has been able to outperform the benchmark index and is currently trading above its smaller degree horizontal trendline on the daily structure.  It is nicely poised above its 21 and 50-day exponential moving average, which is positive for the stock in short to medium-term.  Traders can accumulate the stock in a range of Rs 1,748&ndash;1,759 for the target of Rs 1,850 with a stop loss below Rs 1,700 on a daily closing basis.  Alembic Pharmaceuticals | Buy | LTP: Rs 643.60 | Target: Rs 730 | Stop loss: Rs 600 | Upside: 13.42%  After multi-years prolonged consolidation, Alembic Pharmaceuticals has given a breakout of its 'falling channel pattern' on the weekly timeframe.  After witnessing a breakout above the trendline, the stock was in consolidation mode for the last few weeks. And during the consolidation mode, the stock has completed its throwback near its trendline support.  The current spurt in prices has witnessed a follow-up buying in the stock.  A strong reversal in momentum oscillator RSI (14) from 30-level has set up a rounding formation and is currently reading above 60-level with positive crossover on the weekly chart.  By observing Relative Strength (RS) on the weekly horizon, one can observe that the stock has been outperforming the benchmark index since January 20.  Traders can accumulate the stock in a range of Rs 644 -653 for the target of Rs 730 with a stop loss below Rs 600 on a daily closing basis.  HDFC Bank | Sell | LTP: Rs 1,149.15 | Target: Rs 1,080 | Stop loss: Rs 1,190 | Downside: 6%  HDFC Bank has breached its eighteen-month upward rising channel and is currently trading below its support level on a weekly timeline.  The majority of Indicators and oscillators are negatively poised and are looking week to drift further. The stock is trading below its 50-week exponential moving average and sharp fall in the stock has forced the prices to breach its horizontal trendline support.  Traders can short the stock in a range of Rs 1,145-1,153 for the target of Rs 1,080 with a stop loss above Rs 1,190 on a daily closing basis.

","The Competition Commission has slapped a penalty of Rs 302 crore on Grasim Industries for abusing its dominant position with respect to supply of a certain staple fibre to spinners. Besides, the company has been directed to &amp;quot;cease and desist&amp;quot; from indulging in anti-competitive practices as well as put in place a transparent &amp;quot;discount policy&amp;quot; for all the market participants.  In a 60-page order, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) said the company has abused its dominant position in the market for supply of VSF to spinners in India by charging discriminatory prices to its customers besides imposing supplementary obligations upon them.  These are in violation of competition norms, it added.  VSF is Viscose Staple Fibre (VSF) and is produced as well as sold by Grasim Industries.  The company has also been directed to &amp;quot;refrain from adopting unfair/ discriminatory pricing practices and also refrain from seeking the consumption details of VSF from the buyers&amp;quot;, the order said.

With healthcare workers like doctors, nurses and allied staff at high risk of contracting the COVID-19 infection, Sagar has divided its doctors and support staff into small batches. Each batch is assigned a particular day of duty. This is to prevent each batch from meet other.  This was done to ensure that the hospital functions serving existing patients and attending emergency cases, while ensuring that its staff are protected.  Track this blog for latest updates on coronavirus outbreak  &amp;quot;It is our responsibility to see that we maintain health our people, so that we continue our operations,&amp;quot; said Dr Jagdish Chandra, Vice President, Medical Services at Sagar Hospitals.  Chandra said they have kept on hold outpatient department (OPD) services and stopped elective surgeries - two major revenue stream for hospitals.  Chandra says despite taking massive hit on operations and revenues, they have to pay wages to staff, rents, utility bills and interest on working capital.  If the current situation prevails beyond a month, Sagar Hospitals may even struggle to pay salaries to its workforce and may have to shut.  Sagar Hospitals has 200 doctors and more than double that number of allied staff on rolls.  The COVID-19 came like a bolt from the blue for private hospitals.  Fuelled by PE funds, many private hospital chains expanded aggressively in the last few years. But most of them are now struggling to stay afloat.  Even India's largest healthcare chains like Apollo Hospitals&nbsp;has warned about the &amp;quot;total crash of the system&amp;quot; if government doesn't step in .  &amp;quot;Hospital industry is going through trying times.

This effort is aimed at creating isolation and quarantine facilities and reducing the burden on hospitals providing acute care.  Joining hands with partners including HUL, SBI and OYO, Apollo Hospitals plans to scale this capacity to up to 5,000 rooms where patients can stay in isolation.  'Project Stay I' (Stay Isolated) is a part of its 'Project Kavach' announced last week by Apollo Hospitals Group Chairman Prathap C Reddy to fight the VOVID-19 pandemic.  &amp;quot;Apollo along with our partners commits to add up to 5,000 rooms where patients can stay in isolation. These will be 5,000 telemedicine medically supervised beds so that those who are in isolation stay in isolation and don't spread the infection to others,&amp;quot; Apollo Hospitals Group Joint MD Sangita Reddy said.  Isolation is not possible in many Indian homes where 5-7 people stay in the same room and where they share a bathroom, she said.  &amp;quot;So we realised for those who can't afford, there was need to find capacity to cover the cost, and HUL, SBI and Deutsche Bank have come forward and said for those who cannot afford it they will cover the cost of care,&amp;quot; she added.  &amp;quot;Apollo Hospitals is not charging for the the telemedicine network or our medical supervision. Only the medicines will be charged at actual costs and the MRPs,&amp;quot; Reddy said.  As part of phase 1, Apollo Hospitals is launching around 500 rooms in Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi which will be scaled up to 5,000 rooms across other cities in successive phases on the basis pf further assessment, she added.  &amp;quot;Project Stay I will help to 'Break the chain' and is expected to help over?10,000 patients in a month and prevent over 50 lakh infections,&amp;quot; Reddy said.  For the 'Project Stay I', initiative Apollo Hospitals has partnered with hospitality chains such as Lemon Tree Hotels, Ginger Hotels and OYO and online restaurant guide and food ordering platform Zomato.  Apart from them, leading entities such as HUL, State Bank of India and Deutsche Bank have also joined hands in the initiative.  The objective is to create isolation and quarantine facilities away from the main hospitals in cities across the country and reduce the burden on hospitals providing acute care.  &amp;quot;The steps taken by the Government of India in screening, testing and keeping high risk individuals in state quarantine facilities to prevent the extensive spread of the disease is indeed commendable. However, with increase in the scale and scope of testing, the number of positive cases are expected to increase,&amp;quot; Reddy said in the media conference call.  There will also be a rise in the number of individuals requiring to be quarantined due to contact with COVID-19 patients. This will put a huge load on the government facilities for quarantine. This is the time for the private sector to step up to the challenge to aid, augment, and support the government, she added.  The model is envisaged to have a combination of self-paying and CSR funded customers, Apollo Hospitals said.  On the development, HUL Chairman and MD Sanjiv Mehta said: &amp;quot;Isolation facilities are extremely important to curb the spread of this virus. As Hindustan Unilever we are delighted to partner with organisations like Apollo Hospitals, State Bank of India, Oyo, Lemon Tree and many more to help create isolation facilities.&amp;quot;  This will help in augmenting the quarantine system already put in place by the government, he added.  Biocon Chairperson and MD Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said: &amp;quot;We have a very small window of opportunity to really make a success of lockdown, of quarantine and making sure we don't get overwhelmed in terms of the need for critical care.&amp;quot;  'Project Stay I' is a very important initiative that is being embarked upon. This is a model that needs to emulated by all the hospitals and hotels put together, she added.  OYO Founder &amp;amp;amp; Group CEO Ritesh Agarwal said: &amp;quot;Our partnership with Apollo Hospitals has been developed to ensure we utilise capacity where possible to create highly sanitised pay per use quarantine facilities under the guidance and supervision of medical professionals.&amp;quot;  This is an unprecedented situation which requires all of us to find new ways to work together and rise to the occasion, he added.  Highlighting the need of the initiative, Deutsche Bank India Chief Country Officer Kaushik Shaparia said: &amp;quot;We've seen with other countries that people needing intensive medical care can very quickly outrun the available facilities. This partnership is a step towards addressing that challenge and the model provides an excellent way by which to respond quickly to people in need and curtail further spread of the disease.&amp;quot;  On their role in 'Project Stay I', Zomato Co-Founder &amp;amp;amp; COO Gaurav Gupta said: &amp;quot;We are glad to team up with Apollo Hospitals and other service providers for 'Project Stay I' and lend our services to make sure people in isolation have access to good food. We are enabling our network for the supply and employing our logistics capabilities to facilitate daily meals.&amp;quot;  Stating that Lemon Tree Hotels has been in the forefront in partnering with government on fight against COVID-19 pandemic, Lemon Tree Hotels President Vikramjit Singh said: &amp;quot;From the beginning of this crisis, Lemon Tree has supported state governments in offering quarantine accommodation and we are now happy to partner with Apollo Hospitals on 'Project Stay I'.&amp;quot;  Lemon Tree Hotels believes it is extremely important for the private sector, especially hospitality, to play an active role in helping the government control this pandemic, he added.","Apollo Hospitals, Business, Companies, Ginger Hotels, Lemon Tree","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/covid-19-apollo-teams-upoyo-lemon-tree-ginger-hotels-to-create-5000-isolation-rooms_13628401.html
15,2020-04-01 14:21:40+05:30,Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd.,APOLLOHOSP,Coronavirus pandemic: This is how India is trying to overcome ventilator shortage,"Experts say, if COVID-19 cases surge in days ahead, we may struggle as nearly 3 percent of COVID-19 patients would require ventilators.","Apollo Hospitals, India's largest healthcare provider, said it had 1,000 ventilators across its network hospitals. The hospital chain - without specifying the number - said it had dedicated a portion of those ventilators for treating COVID-19 patients.  Hospitals are now earmarking isolation wards to treat COVID-19 patients so that other patients and staff are protected from the novel coronavirus infection.  A ventilator is a mechanical breathing device that can blow air and oxygen into the lungs. Ventilators are critical for the care of people with lung failure, which can be one of the complications suffered by patients with severe COVID-19.  While on paper 1,000 ventilators sounds a big number, what will be available for COVID-19 patients in reality is much lower as hospitals have to reserve ventilators to treat non-COVID-19 cases such as heart attacks, strokes and other emergency cases.  There is a huge cost element, too, in using ventilators. A ventilator costs anywhere between Rs 5-15 lakh.  &amp;quot;Generally, we keep three ventilators for 10 beds ICU. These machines are expensive, so hospitals typically bill them as part of ICU charges, some bill them separately as well,&amp;quot; said Dr. Rajendra Patankar, Chief Executive Officer of Pune-based Jupiter Hospital.  The average ICU charges per day in Mumbai is Rs 4,000. In some high-end tertiary hospitals, the charges will go upwards of Rs 20,000 per day. These are conservative estimates taken from publicly available information. More than two-thirds of the ICU billing constitutes ventilator charges.  Catch COVID-19 outbreak LIVE updates&nbsp;here   As per a Brookings report, the country might need anywhere between 110,000 - 220,000 ventilators by May 15 in the worst-case scenario. The number of ventilators today available in the country is a maximum of 57,000. Most of those available ventilators cannot be put to use.  But, experts say we may struggle if COVID-19 cases surge in days ahead as nearly 3 percent of COVID-19 patients would require ventilators. Experts across the spectrum ranging from doctors to engineers and entrepreneurs are trying to solve the ventilator puzzle.    India has reported a total of 1,251 positive coronavirus cases as of March 31 morning.  Addressing ventilator shortage  The government has declared essential technical features for COVID-19 ventilators.  As per the government specification, a ventilator should be turbine, compressor based because the installation sites might not have central oxygen lines. Among other features, the machine should have invasive, non-invasive and CPAP features to make them versatile. They also need to have 200-600 ML tidal volume, Lung Mechanics Display and continuous working capability for 4-5 days.  But, to get ventilators of those specifications will take time. Moneycontrol earlier reported that companies were running low on inventories. Getting components from China has become difficult due to the disruption of the supply chain. Sources have told Moneycontrol that China, too, has started clamping down on exports of ventilators and related components to shore up its own requirement.  &ldquo;To tackle the shortage of ventilators India should go in for two-three models, one an low-cost respirator model for epidemic and a high-end technology ICU model,&amp;quot; said Rajiv Nath, Forum Coordinator - Association of Indian Medical Device Industry (AiMed), the domestic medical devices trade lobby.  AiMeD said it contacted seven of its ten major manufacturers, which had confirmed that the current production capacity of ventilators was 5,500-5,750 pieces per month. This is where defense labs, big automotive and capital goods companies are coming to rescue.  Maruti Suzuki India, Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra, Bharat Forge, Tata Motors, Hyundai and public sector BHEL, BEL and DRDO are coming up offering their expertise to rapidly scale up production of ventilators.  For instance - SkanRay, Mysuru-based ventilator manufacturer has created a consortium with BEL, BHEL and Mahindra to ramp up production from standard 2,000 units per month to 30,000 units per month by May.  Similarly, Delhi-NCR-based Agva has tied up with Maruti to scale up production from 400 units per month to 10,000 pcs per month by May. Others are similarly gearing up to address the challenge.  &amp;quot;The aim is to produce 50,000 ventilators per month by May,&amp;quot; Nath said.  SkanRay, the leading ventilator manufacturer, has created a consortium with BEL, BHEL and Mahindra to ramp up production from standard 2,000 pieces per month to currently 5,000 pieces per month and 30,000 pieces per month by May. Similarly, Agva has tied up with Maruti to scale up production from 400 pieces per month to 4,000 pieces per month in April to 10,000 pieces per month by May. Others are similarly gearing up to address the challenge.  No frill 'Ambu Bag'   While the conventional ventilators are expensive, hard to produce and not portable, experts say we may have to find other ways to tide over the ventilator shortage if we begin to see a surge of cases.  One of the solutions put forward was the bag-valve mask, often called by the proprietary name of &lsquo;Ambu Bag,&rsquo; used for resuscitation in emergency situations.  &amp;quot;The &lsquo;bag valve mask&rsquo; is currently hand-powered and, therefore, not suitable for continuous use as a ventilator. It would be easy to design a similar device powered by an electrical source, which could be a car battery, apart from the conventional power supply. It could be made portable, and therefore adopted in villages and other areas without a power supply and be inexpensive enough to manufacture in bulk,&amp;quot; said Prof BS Murty, Director - IIT Hyderabad and Prof. V. Eswaran of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, IIT Hyderabad.  Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra is working on an automated version of the Bag Valve Mask ventilator (commonly known as Ambu bag). Once proven, Mahindra says this design will be made available to all for manufacturing. Bag Valve Mask can be used and thrown away, removing the possibility of cross-contamination.  Anand Mahindra, Chairman of Mahindra Group announced it will cost below Rs 7,500.  CPAP - an interim solution  Another interim solution that companies have started working on is converting Continuous Positive Airway Pressure or CPAP machines as breath support devices for COVID-19 patients.  CPAP machines help people with sleep apnea breathe more easily. It is also widely used in premature babies whose lungs are not fully developed and require respiratory support. A CPAP machine increases the air pressure in a person's throat to prevent airway from collapsing when inhaled.  Bengaluru-based InnAccel is working to develop a CPAP that can be used for COVID-19 patients needing breathing support.  InnAccel develops and markets a portable CPAP machine called 'Saans' &ndash; that runs on a battery where there is no power source. It can also be hand-pumped if the battery fails.  &amp;quot;A bag valve mask is the simplest level of ventilation. We should use it but I don't think that is anyway adequate for COVID-19 patients. But, there are intermediate modes between absolutely high-end ventilators and a rudimentary bag in mask. CPAP is one mode,&amp;quot; said Siraj Dhanani, co-founder and CEO of InnAccel.  Dhanani said they were working on a prototype based on their CPAP platform to develop devices for COVID-19 patients.  The government specified ventilators should have basic modes such as pressure control, volume control and pressure support ventilation, along with CPAP.  Splitting ventilators  Doctors and engineers are also scrambling to figure out how to modify their ventilators to serve a large number of patients with limited resources.  A team at Delhi-NCR based hospital chain Max Healthcare was able to split their ventilator, which can be used for upto four patients if necessary.  The critical care experts at Max Healthcare extensively tested the device and determined that it worked very well on all functional and patient safety parameters. The device is to be used only in case of dire shortage of ventilators and when we have a large number of patients needing ventilator support. It is not simple as it sounds though.  &amp;quot;My team and I then designed a simple but ingenious device, which can be safely attached to the ventilators, splitting the airflow into four distinct streams for 4 patients. We even produced this device in-house using the 3D printing facilities at Max Healthcare,&rdquo; said Yudhvir Singh, Head - BioMedical Engineering, Max Healthcare.  Currently, Max Healthcare has 254 adult ventilators across its network. It is not Max alone; other hospitals have also started work on splitting ventilators.

17,2020-04-03 09:03:28+05:30,LTIMindtree Ltd.,LTIM,"Hot Stocks | LTI, Voltas, L&amp;amp;T three stock ideas for the next 3-4 weeks","Current chart formation suggests a sustained rise above 7,900 will surely create a demand zone for the benchmark index.","  Rohan Patil  The benchmark index Nifty on April 1 witnessed a smaller degree upward rising trend line breakdown.  The index, on the daily chart, has given a pennant pattern breakdown. Pennant pattern normally acts as a continuation pattern of the prevailing trend.  The Indian stock market witnessed one of the steepest monthly falls and shut the shop in deep red with a fall of more than 23 percent in March 2020 on a monthly closing basis.  Momentum Oscillator RSI (14) seems to have flattened out in an oversold zone and looks least concerned to spike on weekly charts.  Nifty confirmed its closing below a 100-month exponential moving average (EMA), which is placed at around 8,850 level on the monthly time frame.  Previously, 100-EMA on the monthly chart was breached during the period of November 2008 to February 2009, and their aftermarket witnessed a sharp reversal and since then it never revisited its 100-EMA on a monthly interval.  Bank Nifty is underperforming the benchmark index Nifty on the weekly chart which is observed by relative strength (RS) indicator.  In the banking sector, state-run banks are underperforming private sector banks. In the majority of banking stocks, technical indicators and oscillators are in oversold zone and are not in any hurry to spike up.  Current chart formation suggests a sustained rise above 7,900 will surely create a demand zone for the benchmark index.  A break below the said level will make Nifty test 7,341 in the coming weeks which is supported by Fibonacci retracement level. However, on the higher side, the index may continue to face hurdles around 9,000 level.  Here are three stock recommendations for the next 3-4 weeks:  Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro Infotech (LTI) | Buy | LTP: Rs 1,382.20 | Target: Rs 1,575 | Stop loss: Rs 1,290 | Upside: 14%  The stock price seems to have hit its intermediate bottom on the weekly chart and has formed two consecutive green candles.  The 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) is acting as an anchor point and is one of the main reasons for the likely short-term bottom in the stock.  The counter is forming a base near Rs 1,350 levels since the last couple of days, which is supported by momentum oscillator RSI (14) which has rebounded from the oversold zone with positive crossover on the daily interval.  Traders can accumulate the stock in a range of Rs 1,385-1,400 for the target of Rs 1,575 with a stop loss below Rs 1,290 on a daily closing basis.  Voltas | Sell | LTP: Rs 472.55 | Target: Rs 420 | Stop loss: Rs 505 | Downside: 11%  Voltas has breached its almost 30-month long horizontal trendline and is currently trading below its support level on the weekly timeline.  The majority of Indicators and oscillators are negatively poised and looking week to drift further.  The stock has drifted below its 50 and 100-day exponential moving average (EMA) on the weekly time frame, which indicates bears are in full control to push price lower.  The counter is likely to underperform the benchmark index which is visible on the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI).  Traders can short the stock in a range of Rs 470 - 475 for the target of Rs 420 with a stop loss above Rs 505 on a daily closing basis.  Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro (L&amp;amp;amp;T) | Sell | LTP: Rs 775.55 | Target: Rs 690 |Stop loss: Rs 825 | Downside: 11%  A recent pullback in the stock was capped around Rs 890 and it was unable to fill the gap which was created by the gap-down opening of March 23.  The current chart formation suggests prices are likely to form an inverse V-shape bearish pattern on the daily interval.  The monthly chart clearly indicates long-term bearishness in the counter, as prices have witnessed rising channel pattern breakdown.  RSI (14) is in the oversold zone, but the current bear market flow indicates the indicator may stay in the oversold zone for a longer period.

Additionally, berthing of container vessels was disrupted at Mundra, they said.","Berthing operations and truck movement were disrupted over the weekend in at least three ports handled by India's Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd, India's largest port operator, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.  There was no truck movement at three Adani ports in the state of Gujarat on the west coast, Mundra, Dahej and Tuna, the sources said. Additionally, berthing of container vessels was disrupted at Mundra, they said.  Two of the sources said some operations at Mundra were slowly resuming on Monday, but were badly disrupted at the weekend.  &amp;quot;Things came to complete stop over the weekend,&amp;quot; one of them said.  It was not immediately clear why the port operations were disrupted, and Adani did not respond to questions on the disruptions.  The company, however, has &amp;quot;come across rumours that Adani Group's IT infrastructure was hacked,&amp;quot; said a spokesman, although it wasn't clear to what he was referring. There have been no media reports of a breach of IT security at Adani Ports.  &amp;quot;We strongly deny such rumours. We would further like to assure all our stakeholders that our IT security is at par with global best practices,&amp;quot; the spokesman said.  One of the sources said all trucks have been sent out of Adani's Mundra, Dahej and Tuna ports and that the ports were shuttered over the weekend.  &amp;quot;Importers who were scheduled to drop cargo at Mundra are actively looking to reschedule or divert it to other ports such as Kandla, and traders are scampering to arrange alternatives,&amp;quot; the source said.

20,2020-04-16 15:41:42+05:30,Bajaj Finserv Ltd.,BAJAJFINSV," Coronavirus impact | In a feet-on-street industry, here's how Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance has shifted to...","Tarun Chugh, MD &amp;amp; CEO of Bajaj Allianz Life said that employees are being re-trained on using the virtual medium. He added that not a single person will be fired.","When the March 24 lockdown was announced in India, the insurance sector was worried. The concerns stemmed from the fact that agents won't be able to commute to distribute policies.  Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance was also worried, but the&nbsp;fifth-largest private life insurer in the country was prepared to tackle this unprecedented situation.  In an interaction with Moneycontrol, Tarun Chugh, MD &amp;amp;amp; CEO, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance, said considering that the pandemic had affected several parts of the globe, the company was better prepared.   Tarun Chugh, MD &amp;amp;amp; CEO, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance  &amp;quot;While we had a business continuity plan, this is something very different. But we were agile and were able to get up and running soon,&rdquo; he said.  The insurer is a joint venture between Bajaj Finserv and global asset manager and insurer Allianz SE.  For the April to February period (FY20), Bajaj Allianz Life collected first year premium of Rs 4593.36 crore, showing a 22.8 percent year-on-year growth.  Talking about the business prospects, Chugh said it is difficult to predict impact of COVID-19 on the sector.  Also Read: Live updates on Coronavirus outbreak in India  &amp;quot;Everybody (in the insurance sector) is going to work on three scenario basis, best case, worst case and realistic case. It will take time to get back to normal. Whether it is July, September or January we don&rsquo;t really know,&amp;quot; he said.  The distribution challenge  For the life insurance industry, agency is the major source of distribution. These individuals are the feet-on-street who visit clients and sell insurance products. But insurers have been forced to suspend face-to-face sales.  &amp;quot;The last 15 days of March accounts for almost 12 percent of the life insurance industry&rsquo;s annual business. We realized that the entire distribution has to work differently and things need to be virtual (or aided virtual) and video-centric,&amp;quot; he added.    Chugh explained that the company now has something called a daily choreography where employees are given training on how to divide their day and how to pitch to customers over call.  &ldquo;Insurance has a lot to do about personal connect. Hence, the company invested in an entire rehaul of the training infrastructure. Sales staff is being trained on how to pitch differently, how to strike a conversation over call and how to have a more empathetic discussion with customers,&rdquo; he added.  How is employee management being done?  There is a lot of uncertainty in the market about the future of employment since there is no clear direction about how COVID-19 will pan out and how long it will take to be eradicated.  However, Bajaj Allianz Life is clear that it will stay invested in all of its 10,000 employees in the company.  &ldquo;Normally this is a time of the year when the churn happens in the staff strength. But we are going to retrain employees who are on performance improvement processes. Not a single employee will be &nbsp;fired,&rdquo; added Chugh. The company also paid salaries five days in advance in March 2020 (on March 25) to all its employees.  Despite the lockdown, since insurance is classified as an essential service, all services are up and running.  Out of its 10,000 staff, about three to five of Bajaj Allianz Life&rsquo;s employees are required to go to office to handle the servers. These employees have special passes and travel to switch on/off the devices and servers.  How are customers being handled?  Policy sales continues to happen online across life insurance companies. The only difference is that customers do not need to interact through any intermediary.  Chugh explained that medical examination done before policy sales has now gone virtual. The idea, he said, is to waive lengthy underwriting processes.  &amp;quot;We have trained employees to medical underwriting using video. Customers talk directly to the underwriter and is willing to disclose a lot more. However, those will pre-existing ailments will need proper physical medical tests done which may not be possible right now,&amp;quot; he added.  There is also a perception that considering the mortality rate under COVID-19, more Indians will realise the need to have a basic life insurance cover.  Chugh said that while there may not be an immediate demand, in the medium to long term, individuals will realise the need to buy a risk cover.  &ldquo;The shift will be towards guarantee-based products. How soon? We will have to wait and watch,&rdquo; he added.  In Charts | Economic impact of lockdown on Centre and states  Traditionally, the June quarter is a slow period for the life insurance sector. More than half the annual sales is done in the second of a fiscal. Even if the lockdown is lifted on May 3, industry officials expect revival in business to take another three to four months from that date.

The company sells the surface cleaning robot starting Rs 75,000 per unit.  Logistics issues  &amp;quot;Due to lockdown, we have only been able to deliver in Gurugram and Delhi; for the rest of India we are having difficulty as courier services are yet to resume operations fully,&amp;quot; Karwal said.  Karwal said the rise in demand is due to shortage of workers, strict social distancing norms and disinfection procedures adopted in hospitals, hotels and offices.  Milagrow developed the entire software and sources 40 percent of components locally, the remaining components such as IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), sensors, actuators are imported from South Korea, Japan, China and Israel. The company assembles the final product in India. It has the capacity to assemble about 10,000 units per month.  &amp;quot;We are selling from our stocks available with us, we are unable to import any components,&nbsp;due to non-availability of&nbsp;logistics,&amp;quot; Karwal said.

EBIT margins improved by 110 bps sequentially to 17.3%, adjusted for the contribution to the PM Cares fund. Net profit beat the estimates, aided by lower taxes and higher forex gains. Revenues from five of the top 10 clients were subdued as growth was led by non-top 20 clients. Revenue growth also aided by onshore revenue productivity, up 9% qoq (after a 3.4% qoq increase in the Dec&rsquo;19 quarter), which might have aided margins as volume growth was a mere 1.1%. LTI remains a stronger Tier II player backed by strong and stable leadership and execution track record, which reflects in the steady rise across client revenue buckets and a steadier margin profile (unlike volatility seen in most Tier II techs as well as a few in Tier I).  Outlook While we raise our FY21/22E EPS slightly, valuations at ~20x/17x FY21/22E EPS are punchy, given a possible hit to demand due to weak global macro.

Consolidated topline was flat at 2% YoY to Rs 13294 crore, primarily led by slower traction in premium accretion in insurance business that was offset by healthy traction in lending business. Bajaj Finance, lending arm, made a contingent provision of Rs 900 crore amid Covid-19, while insurance business took a MTM hit of Rs 768 crore on equity investment, led by steep decline in value of equity market. This has led to a 63% YoY decline in PBT to Rs 793 crore. Resultantly, consolidated PAT came at Rs 194 crore, down 77% YoY. Excluding the provision for Covid-19, PAT would have been Rs 1000 crore.

During the first phase of lockdown till April 19, the company said its offices, storage locations and production facility remained closed, and the company maintained minimum level of operations to ensure timely supply of goods and services to its customers in the essential sectors.  AEL's core business segments are integrated coal management, mining services, solar manufacturing, airports operations and maintenance, and road and water infrastructure.  &amp;quot;As AEL's core segments are linked with power generation industry which falls under essential service, it becomes imperative for AEL to ensure timely and sufficient supply of coal. During the lockdown, we have ensured continued supply to customers strictly following Government guidelines,&amp;quot; the company said in a BSE filing.  AEL said it continued its operations in mines even in the first stage of lockdown, as supply of coal falls under exemption category with safety and wellbeing of workers and staff given utmost priority.  &amp;quot;The company resumed operations at its production facility, certain offices and few critical storage facilities from April 20, 2020 after obtaining necessary regulatory approvals and clearances. With further relaxations being given in the month of May, we have furthered the operations in the phased manner, strictly adhering to government guidelines and ensuring safety and well-being of our employees,&amp;quot; it said.  About financial impact on operations, it said coal supplies were continuous to State Electricity Boards (SEBs) during this period but overall demand was impacted due to lesser power demand and excess domestic cargo being available at coal mines.  &amp;quot;Our sales volumes are expected to be impacted in Q1 FY21. Also margins are expected to be slightly lower in the short run due to excess flow of supply in the market,&amp;quot; the company said.  About mining services, it said that power demand and consequent coal demand was partially impacted in Rajasthan during the lockdown.  Post easing, demand of power has gone up and demand of coal is expected to be back to normal, it said.  &amp;quot;We expect to maintain healthy level of volumes despite above aberrations.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation, the government had announced a country wide lockdown, involving restrictions on international and domestic travel, while also issuing an advisory on postponing elective surgeries and undergoing preventive health checks,&nbsp;Apollo Hospitals said in a filing to the BSE.  The pandemic has led to a material impact on the healthcare industry in general and on company's healthcare services business operations due to severe travel related restrictions impacting both employee movements and patient flows to the hospitals, it added.  Coronavirus India News LIVE Updates  Outpatient footfalls were also impacted apart from incidence of postponement of elective procedures. Both factors in turn have led to a substantial reduction in the inpatient case loads, the filing said.  The current embargo on international travel has also impacted patient flows to hospital units located in metro locations such as Chennai, Hyderabad, New Delhi and Ahmedabad, it added.  The company pointed out that none of its operations were closed during this phase.  It stated that, &amp;quot;Our stand alone pharmacy segmental revenues and business performance were not impacted during the lockdown, and continue to show growth momentum.&amp;quot;  However, &amp;quot;as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic situation, the overall patient volumes across our hospitals network has reduced by half, thereby adversely impacting healthcare segmental revenues while fixed costs required for maintaining business continuity continued to be incurred,&amp;quot; the filing said.  The company has embarked on a host of cost optimisation measures to alleviate the situation, it added.  &amp;quot;However, we do not anticipate any issues at all related to the company's ability to undertake borrowings or service debt given its comfortable liquidity position and its ability to access debt at competitive levels, even in the current situation,&amp;quot; Apollo Hospitals said.  The company has undrawn credit lines of Rs 400 crore and also has very strong relationships with large bankers in India, including development finance institutions&nbsp;(DFIs) who have expressed interest to support through debt -- short and long tenured, should the company need it, it added.  &amp;quot;Given the current huge demand supply imbalance that persists with regard to healthcare infrastructure within the country, Apollo Hospitals as the largest private health care services provider with its portfolio of more than 10,000 hospital beds is well positioned to continue to address the demand for high quality tertiary care across the country over the long term,&amp;quot; it said.  The company does not anticipate any risks related to recoverability of receivables or supply chain related bottlenecks. Further, there has been no impact on internal financial controls in the current situation, it added.  On the future impact of the pandemic on the company's operations, Apollo Hospitals said it is still evaluating the full impact of the current situation on its business and will continuously calibrate responses to the COVID-19 situation as it evolves.  &amp;quot;We would like to however state that patient case loads and occupancies across our hospitals network have witnessed improvements post easing of lockdown related restrictions,&amp;quot; it added.

45,2020-06-12 13:56:29+05:30,Tata Consumer Products Ltd.,TATACONSUM,Pockets of opportunity: Analysts pick 12 midcap stocks with one-year horizon,"The road ahead for the market is bumpy and a lot will depend on the course of coronavirus pandemic. Moreover, global cues and measures of governments and central banks will remain important factors for the market.","  The Indian market continues to remain volatile following global cues. The sentiment is fragile as there are concerns that rising cases of COVID-19 in India can trigger a fresh lockdown.  The road ahead for the market is bumpy and a lot will depend on the course of coronavirus pandemic. Moreover, global cues and measures of governments and central banks will remain important triggers for the market.  Sensex has seen over 500 points rise and fall quite a few times in the last few months and such volatility has started to appear normal these days.  During such uncertain times, a prudent, stock-specific approach is important to maximise the gains and minimise the risk.  While analysts advise going for bluechip stocks that are cash-rich, have brand value, bigger market share and leadership qualities, there are pockets of opportunities in the midcap space too.  &amp;quot;We need to be stock-specific in mid and small-caps and consider businesses available at attractive prices and stable outlook. Stocks in segments like chemical, agro, pharma, IT and exports will do better in this transition,&amp;quot; Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.  Here are 12 midcap stocks that analysts have suggested from various sectors with one-year horizon. Take a look:  Analyst: Siddharth Khemka, Head &ndash; Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services  Tata Consumer Products | Buy | LTP: Rs 376 | Target price: 431 | Upside: 15%  Tata Group has a clear focus on leveraging its brand and participating in India&rsquo;s consumption story of Rs 30 lakh crore, which resulted in the merger of Tata Chemicals&rsquo; Consumer business with Tata Global Beverages creating Tata Consumer Ltd.  The merger offers multiple synergies including higher outlet coverage, focused new product development, stronger cash flow generation, and scale efficiencies.  &amp;quot;We are positive on Tata Consumer given its strong balance sheet, robust FCF generation and excellent management quality. Given the resilient nature of its portfolio, we expect revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR at 9 percent/14 percent/19 percent, respectively, over FY20-FY22E,&amp;quot; said the analyst.  Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro Infotech (LTI) | Buy | LTP: Rs 1,874.85 | Target price: 2,060 | Upside: 10%  Strong exit growth in FY20 coupled with healthy deal wins reiterates our confidence that LTI could be one of the few outliers reporting revenue/earnings growth in FY21.  The company&rsquo;s twisted seasonality (better second half) should also help it dodge the peak COVID-19 impact to an extent.  LTI&rsquo;s recent client addition across buckets was the strongest and broad-based against comparable prior periods. It has recently added several marquee logos (e.g. Standard Chartered). Industry-leading &lsquo;growth&rsquo; plus prudent capital allocation should defend its rich multiples.  The analyst expects LTI to be a key beneficiary of the accelerated digital adoption in the post-COVID-19 world.  Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail | Buy | LTP: Rs 129.50 | Target price: Rs 190 | Upside: 47%  The company&rsquo;s execution over the last five years has been par excellence, with the lifestyle segment being the largest branded apparel player and its acquisition of Pantaloons.  As casualization is emerging as the new trend, the company is fully prepared to increase its share. The analyst highlighted the company is also the largest mask seller in the market. The company has remained a dominant player in the apparel industry with a strong parentage, ensuring bank credit facilities would offer the company adequate support to weather the storm better than competitors.  Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail seeks to raise Rs 1,000 crore through a rights issue, with a commitment of subscription from promoters (in case not fully subscribed).  &amp;quot;This should save Rs 100 crore in interest cost annually and enhance the company&rsquo;s liquidity position. We expect a revival in FY22E, with EBITDA of Rs 630 crore, 35 percent growth over FY20,&amp;quot; said the analyst.  Gujarat Gas | Buy | LTP: Rs 290.90 | Target price: Rs 370 | Upside: 27%  The growth in FY20 is completely attributable to Morbi, where the overnight shift to gas from dirtier fuelled to the huge demand boost.  &amp;quot;We believe that industrial volumes (further supported by NGT reforms in India) would be a clear winner for long-term growth. With an increasing number of CNG stations and focus on reducing vehicular pollution, penetration in the CNG segment is expected to increase,&amp;quot; said the analyst.  Gujarat Gas has a huge advantage of volume boost from the NGT&rsquo;s stringent directives, which should drive volume CAGR of nearly 10 percent over the medium-term on the highest volume base among its peers.  &amp;quot;We are positive due to the best RoE profile of nearly 24-26 percent and expected FCF generation of nearly Rs 2,130 crore over the next 2 years (nearly 11 percent of its current market cap),&amp;quot; said the analyst.  Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra Financial Services | Buy | LTP: Rs 156.90 | Target price: Rs 200 | Upside: 27  Tractor segment is witnessing decent demand on the back of normal rainfall expected this year and good Rabi harvest. Further, with the government&rsquo;s stimulus package aimed towards providing support to the rural economy and MSMEs, demand for tractors and pre-owned vehicles is set to rise.  This would benefit M&amp;amp;amp;M Finance as it has a large exposure to the rural market. At the same time, liquidity and collections would remain the key focus area for the company, thus managing balance sheet stress.  &amp;quot;Over the next two years, MMFS would deliver an about 2 percent loan CAGR, while credit cost would rise to 4 percent in FY21 and 3.5 percent in FY22 from 2.8 percent in FY20E. Margins may improve modestly as the company would benefit from a benign interest rate environment,&amp;quot; said the analyst.  Brokerage firm: Anand Rathi  Carborundum Universal | Buy | LTP: Rs 246 | Target price: Rs 303 | Upside: 23%  The company's management expects demand to pick up in-line with improving utilisation level of key industries such as autos and construction.  Management is confident of a steady margin ahead, focusing on operating efficiency, cost control, launches of products in ceramics moving out of the loss-suffering Foskor Zirconia this year.  Abrasives will continue to be constrained until manufacturing picks up. Ceramics would add to healthy growth because of good demand in Australia and in metallised cylinders.  With its focus on operating efficiency, cost-control, launches of products in ceramics and quitting the loss-suffering Foskor Zirconia this year, management is confident of steady margins ahead.  &amp;quot;We have raised earnings estimates with a moderate increase in revenues and higher EBITDA margin for FY21/22E. We upgrade the stock to a 'buy' with a revised target price of Rs 303 (22 times FY22e),&amp;quot; said the brokerage.  Cipla | Buy | LTP: Rs 635.95 | Target price: Rs 738 | Upside: 16%  On the product filing front, Cipla has filed 259 ANDAs (Abbreviated New Drug Application) with the USFDA cumulatively (FY20) with 175 of them already approved and 22 tentative approvals. The company currently spends 7-8 percent of revenues on R&amp;amp;amp;D.  In the domestic market, Cipla remains among the top five players, due to a complete range of product offerings, which covers almost all therapies, and is built on a network of nearly 7,500 medical representatives (MRs) covering a doctor base of nearly 5,00,000.  &amp;quot;We believe with healthy earnings growth and core ROCE expansion over FY20-22E, valuations are likely to witness re-rating,&amp;quot; said the brokerage.  Granules India | Buy | LTP: Rs 199.40 | Target price: Rs 227 | Upside: 14%  The dominance in key APIs (paracetamol, ibuprofen, metformin) would help Granules emerge a prime beneficiary as the COVID-19 outbreak has led to a surge in demand for such drugs.  Granules is likely to retain strong traction for the next couple of years driven by formulations and the healthy contribution from new capacities.  &amp;quot;We expect nearly 25 percent and 23 percent revenue/PAT CAGRs over FY20-22. At the current market price, the stock trades at 9 times FY22E EPS of Rs 20,&amp;quot; said the brokerage.  About 38 percent of promoters&rsquo; holdings have been pledged which the brokerage sees as a risk for the stock. An increase in R&amp;amp;amp;D spend and adverse currency movements can also dent the growth numbers of the company.  KEI Industries | Buy | LTP: Rs 330.35 | Target price: Rs 411 | Upside: 24%  The strong order book of Rs 3,300 crore, including Rs 730 crore of EHV and Rs 1,640 crore exports, diversified customers and healthy balance sheets are positives.  The Rs 150 crore order for 400kVA cables (EHV) now places KEI among the world&rsquo;s top manufacturer. The recent fundraising (Rs 500 crore) has helped repay debt and is good for future CAPEX.  &amp;quot;We remain positive on KEI and retain our 'buy' rating for its leading position in cables, healthy order book, diversified customers and better balance sheet,&amp;quot; said the brokerage.  Analyst: Amarjeet Maurya, AVP - Mid-Caps, Angel Broking  Radico Khaitan | Buy | LTP: Rs 338.80 | Target price: Rs 397 | Upside: 17%  Radico Khaitan (RKL) is a leading manufacturer of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL). It has a strong pan-India presence with growing sales in the premium brands like Magic Moments Vodka, 8PM Premium Black Whisky, etc.  Going forward, we expect RKL to report healthy profitability mainly due to strong sales growth in premium product segment (brand extension and launches in new states) and reduction in interest cost,&amp;quot; said the analyst.  Swaraj Engines | Buy | LTP: Rs 1,234.95 | Target price: Rs 1,507 | Upside: 22%  Swaraj Engines is engaged in the business of manufacturing diesel engines and hi-tech engine components.  &amp;quot;Diesel engines are specifically designed for tractor applications. Going forward, we expect a recovery in tractor industry (due to robust Rabi crop production, hike in MSP and the forecast of a normal monsoon) will benefit players like Swaraj Engines,&amp;quot; said the analyst.  Hawkins Cooker | Buy | LTP: Rs 4,170 | Target price: Rs 4,912 | Upside: 18%  Over the last two years, the company has outperformed TTK Prestige (market leader) in terms of sales growth nearly 13 percent against about 4 percent in cookers and cookware segments.  Cooking gas (LPG) penetration has increased from 56 percent in FY2014 to 80 percent currently, which would drive higher growth for cookers and cookware compared to the past.  &amp;quot;Going forward, we expect the company to report healthy top-line and bottom-line growth on the back of government initiatives, new product launches, strong brand name and wide distribution network,&amp;quot; said the analyst.

Collection efficiency in April and May was around 15% and 30% respectively, and the management expects significant uptick in June with increasing customers being able to deploy vehicles. SHTF did not seek moratorium from lenders till 31st May as it had robust liquidity. For the second phase (June-August), company has approached its bankers and expects most of them to provide consent. As on May 31, liquidity buffer stood at Rs.57bn. In Q2 FY21 and Q3 FY21 debt repayments are ~Rs40bn, which would be taken care by expected moratorium from banks/fresh funding (healthy sanction pipeline), improving collections and sustained traction in retail deposits (all branches activated), in addition to the aforesaid cash buffer. Capital position of SHTF is strong with Tier-1 capital at 18% and D/E at 5x. With the impact of Covid being inculcated in ECL model, the credit cost run-rate will remain elevated in coming quarters. Management expects worst case to be 3%.  Outlook Retain BUY rating with a 12m TP of Rs880. Believe SHTF is better placed than peers on capital position and potential recovery in collection efficiency during June-August (resilient client base). SHTF trades at 0.9x/5.4x FY22 ABV/EPS. Visibility of RoA climbing back above 2% in FY22 will re-rate valuation.

Q4FY20 witnessed 70%+ decline in PAT both YoY/QoQ to Rs2.2bn (PLe:Rs7.9bn) largely on account of Rs9.1bn COVID provisioning. Business trends stood weaker than expectations for 81-day quarter with AUMs at Rs1097bn (PLe:Rs1117bn) growing flattish QoQ (5% up YoY) led by slowing pace of used CV financing with avg growth of 1.4% over H2FY20. Disbursals at Rs109bn de-grew 5%QoQ as used CV disbursals were down 4%. While used CV has steadily risen, now at 86% of overall mix, SHTF stands as a bigger beneficiary of cyclical upturn on the used CV finance side. However, near term COVID led business impact looms large led by lower fleet utilization levels (50-70% Jun'20 and ahead), 70% AUMs under moratorium (May'20) &amp;amp;amp; 80-90% (Jun-Aug'20), Rs80bn repayment obligations (Jun-Dec'20) and therefore liquidity maintenance taking precedence. While collection efficiency at 52% (May-end) does not stand sacrosanct with customers not paying in entirety, we believe asset quality pain to stay pronounced for FY21.  Outlook Against this backdrop, we trim our growth estimates sharply to 4/10% (earlier 7/16%), maintain high order NPAs at 9%/8.2% &amp;amp;amp; tweak credit costs estimate to 2.6% / marginally lower over FY21/FY22 resp. Consequently, our EPS estimates now stand lower by 31% for FY21 but marginally higher in FY22. As return profile takes a hit, RoEs fall below 15% respectable mark for FY22 prompting us to downgrade stock to Accumulate (earlier BUY). We assign multiple of 1x to BV of FY22 arriving at a price target of Rs809 (earlier Rs940).

The VSF segment's EBITDA/kg was Rs18.1 vs. estimate of Rs14. Key positives: 1) Lower-than-estimated decline in VSF and Caustic soda volumes and 2) 3% qoq reduction in VSF's opex/kg led by lower pulp prices. Key negative was a 5.5pp qoq decline in the Chemical segment's margin vs. estimated 3.6pp decline. Current capacity utilization of VSF is at 30-40%, whereas capacity utilization of the Chemical segment is at 60%. Management believes that a further fall in VSF prices should be restricted as Chinese players are inuring loss of RMB2,000/ton. However, the situation is likely to improve only in Q3 as China had inventory of 125 days at Mar-end.  Outlook We believe that the recovery in key Chemicals and VSF segments is two quarters away. We now factor in only a 50% probability of Grasim having to take up Vodafone Idea's (VIL) debt burden as a promoter as management insists that investments in non-consolidating subsidiaries will be the last priority.

PGCIL is engaged in power transmission business with the responsibility of planning, implementation, operation and maintenance of Inter-State Transmission System.  There have been allegations that PGCIL is at advantage as developer of power transmission projects because it is a central transmission unit (CTU).  &amp;quot;PGCIL shall immediately set up a CTU, a 100 per cent owned subsidiary of PGCIL with separate accounting and board structure, which would be responsible for carrying out statutory functions, as identified for CTU under the Electricity Act 2003, and also other functions assigned to CTU by Central Electricity Regulatory Commission,&amp;quot; the ministry said in a letter to the PGCIL Chairman and MD on June 17, 2020.  The subsidiary would be separated from the Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd (PGCIL) into a new CTU Ltd, a wholly-owed Government of India company, within six months or till the completion of formalities.  As per the letter, the modalities of setting up of the subsidiary would be similar to those adopted during the formation of POSOCO as subsidiary company.  Power System Operation Corp (POSOCO) was also set up as an independent company for ensuring neutrality of the transmission system operations.  POSOCO was earlier part of Power Grid Corporation.

56,2020-06-22 07:13:31+05:30,Bajaj Finserv Ltd.,BAJAJFINSV,Hot Stocks | Here are two short-term buying ideas with 8-10% upside,"Now, the base seems to have shifted higher from 9,700 to 10,000 and here a breach of 10,000 would again apply brakes on the optimism.","  Sameet Chavan  Trading started with a downside gap on Monday (June 15) as the second wave of coronavirus started haunting market participants across the globe.  The sell-off extended to test the sub-9,750 levels but the benchmark made a sharp recovery to end the session in the positive territory. On Tuesday, the news of a clash at the India-China border emerged, and within no time, markets nosedived and remained under pressure for some time.  Fortunately, once again we managed to defend the key levels in the midst of all this uncertainty. The last two sessions turned out to be excellent for the bulls as we witnessed a good broad-based rally to eventually conclude the week convincingly above the 10,200 mark.  For the last couple of weeks, 10,000 had been acting as a sturdy wall. Due to the smart rally towards the fag end of the last week, we finally managed to traverse this barrier and head towards the recent highs.  It is always good to see when a rally is mainly propelled by the banking conglomerates because it generally provides credence to the move.  Looking at Friday&rsquo;s close, the overall setup looks good and ideally we should make a move beyond our recent highs of 10,350-10,400 to test higher levels of 10,600-10,800 in the forthcoming week.  But the threat of the second wave of COVID-19 and the geopolitical concerns are likely to loom over&nbsp;the market for some time.  Hence, if there is no escalation with respect to this, the markets are likely to continue to rise.&nbsp;For the time being, 10,100 followed by 10,000 would be seen as an immediate support zone.  Now, the base seems to have shifted higher from 9,700 to 10,000 and here a breach of 10,000 would again apply brakes on the optimism.  Looking at the broader market participation last week, traders need to keep focusing on individual stocks.  Here are two buy ideas for the next 3-4 weeks:  Bajaj Finserv | Buy | LTP: Rs 5,925 | Target price: Rs 6,200-6,400 | Stop loss: Rs 5330 | Upside: 8%  In the last couple of days, a lot of beaten-down NBFC stocks saw a smart up-move and Bajaj Finserv was no different.  After the March month's substantial drop, this marquee name went into a consolidation mode, which can be termed as a base-building process.  On Friday, the stock prices finally managed to surpass the multiple resistance zone around Rs 5,500-5,550, which eventually confirmed a &lsquo;Bullish Flag&rsquo; pattern.  Most importantly, this move is backed by humongous volumes, providing credibility to the surge.  The way charts are shaped up, we expect the stock to participate heavily in the next leg of the rally. Thus, we recommend going long on a decline around Rs 5,800-5,750 for a positional target of Rs 6,200-6,400 in the coming days.  Firstsource Solutions (FSL) | Buy | LTP: Rs 39.95 | Target price: Rs 44 | Stop loss: Rs 38 | Upside: 10%  After facing resistance around Rs 39.90 twice in the last two months, the stock prices have finally broken above the key resistance confirming a &lsquo;Cup N Handle&rsquo; bullish breakout.  The recent leg of strong up-move is also supported by strong volumes and it also resembles a strong continuation pattern known as &lsquo;Flag&rsquo;.  In addition, prices have also closed above 200-SMA which previously acted as resistance and now indicates a change in polarity.  Momentum oscillator RSI is in the positive zone, supporting our bullish stance. Thus, one can look to buy this stock on minor dips.

The company had posted a net profit of Rs 72.80 crore in the corresponding period of the preceding fiscal, Apollo Hospitals said in a statement.  Consolidated revenue from operations stood at Rs 2,922.43 crore for the quarter under consideration. It was Rs 2,499.50 crore for the same period a year ago, it added.  The company, after meeting the closing conditions for sale of investments in its associate Apollo Munich Health Insurance Company to Housing Development Finance Corporation in the quarter ended March 31, 2020, has recorded a profit of Rs 198.30 crore, which has been disclosed under exceptional items, it said.  For the full fiscal 2019-20, net profit of the company came in at Rs 431.80 crore, as against Rs 200.16 crore in the previous fiscal year.  Revenue from operations stood at Rs 11,246.80 crore for the fiscal, compared to Rs 9,617.44 crore in 2018-19.  &amp;quot;The financial year 2020-21 will be challenging due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID has affected not just the Indian healthcare sector but also other sectors and the global economy,&amp;quot; Apollo Hospitals Chairman Prathap C Reddy said.  The short-term may see an adverse impact on aspects such as medical value travel or medical tourism, but in the longer term, &amp;quot;healthcare being a resilient industry will bounce back to its normal growth,&amp;quot; he added.  On a different note, Reddy said the second decade of the 21st century was supposed to herald automation, artificial intelligence and robotics into healthcare and improve the quality of healthcare delivery.  &amp;quot;Recognising this, we floated a global tender, and after several rounds of selection, chose DXC as our partner in this digital journey.

We reckon consolidated margin could see a ~300bps decline in current fiscal which results in a sharp drop in our earnings forecast and expect consensus to downgrade EPS estimates. While COVID had an impact on hospitals revenues in March (~Rs1bn), it was partly offset by pre-buying seen in the pharmacy business to the tune of Rs700-800mn. Management does expect near term outlook to be challenging, in an echo of similar sentiments expressed by Narayana. Over the longer term, our Sell stance is premised on subdued operating metrics over the full cycle as also the strength of recovery in FY22 hospitals operations.  Outlook We value Apollo hospitals EBIDTA at 9x FY22 EV/EBIDTA, at a discount to street valuation and retain anti-consensus Sell with PT of Rs1,180.

The FMCG firm of the Tata Group was created following the merger of Tata Global Beverages and consumer business of Tata Chemicals.  The chairman said that the merger, which took effect from February, will provide a broader exposure to growth and opportunities in the FMCG space.  &amp;quot;TCPL will aim at emerging into a full-fledged FMCG firm and also scout for new opportunities in the international markets,&amp;quot; Chandrasekaran told shareholders at the company's virtual annual general meeting.  He said the COVID-19 pandemic impacted business in the last quarter of 2019-20 and the first quarter of the current fiscal.  The company is expecting a slow recovery of the supply chain.  &amp;quot;We expect the pandemic to continue in the near term and the company is positive about the current fiscal and beyond,&amp;quot; Chandrasekaran said.  TCPL is looking at a vast portfolio of consumer products, he said, adding, demand for packaged foods is higher than usual as people have been stocking.  The company will strengthen distribution and marketing channels so that its products are available nationwide, he said. It will also bolster presence in the US, UK and Canada.  &amp;quot;We took a conscious call to broaden the focus to make it an integrated food and beverages company,&amp;quot; Chandrasekaran said.  He said during the last financial year, Tata Starbucks opened 39 outlets, taking the total to 185 across the country.  &amp;quot;Owing to the pandemic, only 50 per cent of the outlets are open at the moment,&amp;quot; Chandrasekaran said.","Business, coronavirus, N Chandrasekaran, Tata Consumer Products Ltd","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/tata-consumer-products-to-emerge-as-full-fledged-fmcg-company-n-chandrasekaran_14008281.html

","The current economic scenario in India as well as global markets is challenging but it is also a learning opportunity to closely monitor consumer trends and buying behaviour across markets to effectively adapt business models and product offerings, according to Tata Consumer Products Ltd (TCPL) Chairman N Chandrasekaran.  Addressing shareholders at the first annual general meeting of the company which has been formed after the merger of Tata Global Beverages and consumer products business of Tata Chemicals, Chandrasekaran said the situation arising out of the coronavirus &ldquo;situation has progressively improved&rdquo; though some of the challenges will persist in the short term.  &amp;quot;We will need to focus on realising the revenue and cost synergies from the integration. While the current economic scenario in India as well as international markets is challenging, I believe it is also a learning opportunity, and we will emerge stronger from this,&rdquo; he said in his online address.  Stressing that the &amp;quot;long term growth drivers for the business will remain robust&amp;quot;, Chandrasekaran who is also the Chairman of Tata Sons, said the last few months have been a time of unprecedented change, witnessing significant changes and &ldquo;health and wellness&rdquo; remain a key consumer trend across markets.  &amp;quot;It will be critical to closely monitor consumer trends and buying behaviour across markets, so that we can effectively adapt our business models and product offerings. I think long term growth drivers for the business will remain robust,&amp;quot; he said.  Commenting on the situation arising out of COVID-19, he said, &amp;quot;While some of these challenges will persist in the short term, the situation has progressively improved.&amp;quot;  Replying to a shareholder's query, he said TCPL would continue to expand its distribution network - both online and offline - to have a wider presence and availability of its products.  &amp;quot;Our immediate focus will be to strengthen distribution and make the products available both online and physically and also ensure that we are available nationwide,&rdquo; he said.  Admitting that many of the products are not fully available in the market, Chandrasekaran said TCPL would work to deepen its reach nationwide.  &amp;quot;One of the problems that we have in direct consumer products is many of our products are not fully available. So, we will go to nationwide reach, we will definitely deepen and strengthen the distribution to make sure that all our products are available and we will spend on marketing and come out with programmes to ensure that it is pretty visible,&amp;quot; he added.  According to him, in some business such as water the company has very low market share and would expand its distribution to increase the market share.  &ldquo;Water, we will definitely make it available more broadly and distribution needs to be addressed,&rdquo; he said, adding &ldquo;that would be necessary to make profit in this business.&amp;quot;  TCPL in May had announced acquiring PepsiCo's stake in their joint venture NourishCo Beverages to widen its portfolio in the growing food and beverages space. It has acquired rights over Gluco Plus/Gluco+ brand also.  &amp;quot;PepsiCo had invested around Rs 107 crore and from our point of view, we have paid them Rs 1 crore brand fee,&amp;quot; he said.  While talking about their JV Tata Starbucks, he said it would be slow on expansion because of pandemic though it is &ldquo;very positive and confident&rdquo; about this business.  &amp;quot;Specifically in FY2021, we will probably be slow because of the pandemic. But we will pick it up we are very confident and very positive about this business,&amp;quot; he said but added the company has an aggressive plan, which was developed for opening more stores and penetrate Starbucks into multiple cities.  Tata Starbucks, a 50:50 JV between Tata group firm TCPL and Starbucks Corporation, has added 39 new stores in FY2020, taking the total count to 185 stores in 11 cities.  &ldquo;50 per cent of the stores are open now,&amp;quot; he said.  Over expansion of its tea cafes Tata Cha, Chandrasekaran said it is presently operating at Bangaluru only and would look for its expansion post-COVID only.  He also said that the company is also having several tie-ups to ensure the online availability of its current consumer products portfolio widely available anytime.  When asked about TCPL's plans to expand into the FMCG market, he said, &amp;quot;The company has been only focused on beverages, predominantly tea and coffee for a very, very long time. We were taking a conscious call to create a broader company. So we are focused on beverages and foods now.&rdquo;  Chandrasekaran further said,&amp;quot;We will launch products in other categories in a very calibrated manner in the years to come.&amp;quot;  TCPL owns popular brands like Tata Salt, Tata Tea, Tetley, Eight O' clock and Himalayan Water.","Business, coronavirus, Economy, India, N Chandrasekaran, Tata Consumer Products Ltd","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/current-economic-scenarioindia-as-well-as-global-markets-is-challenging-n-chandrasekaran_14008921.html
65,2020-07-13 18:03:37+05:30,SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd.,SBILIFE,Bright spots emerge in life insurance sector amidst COVID-19 lockdown,"Though there was a decline in new premiums, the rate of decrease was significantly lower than previous months. Among listed insurers, SBI Life Insurance sees a 14.7 percent YoY growth in new premiums","Almost three months after the&nbsp;COVID-19-led national lockdown, life insurance companies are seeing some bright spots in new premium collection. Even though there was a decline in new premiums, the rate of decrease was significantly lower than previous months.  Data from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) showed that the private sector industry saw a 1.28 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in June 2020 new premiums. In May 2020, there was a 28.3 percent decline.  LIC, which saw a 24.3 percent YoY decline in new premiums at Rs 10,211.53 crore in May 2020, saw a 12.7 percent decline in June 2020.  Since the restrictions were lifted in June 2020, there has been a built-up in momentum of policy sales, industry sources said.  &ldquo;During April and May, bank branches were not able to sell any policy. That was not the case in June and the industry benefited,&rdquo; said the chief distribution officer of a mid-sized private life insurer.  &amp;amp;nbsp;    Overall, the industry saw a 10.5 percent YoY decline in new premiums at Rs 28,868.7 crore in June 2020. For the June quarter (Q1), the life insurance industry saw an 18.6 percent YoY decline in new premiums at Rs 49,335.44 crore.  In&nbsp;May 2020, there was a 25.4 percent YoY decrease in new premiums.  A report by Kotak Institutional Equities said that private life insurers reported 7 percent individual annualised premium equivalent (APE) decline in June 2020.  &ldquo;Traction in individual protection policies, selective push of non-participating business and uptick in business through digital channels were likely drivers while unit linked insurance product (Ulips) volumes were weak,&rdquo; said the report.  Among the listed insurers,&nbsp;SBI Life Insurance&nbsp;saw a 14.7 percent YoY growth in new premiums in June 2020, at Rs 1,502.44 crore, making it the largest private life insurer by new premium collection.&nbsp;HDFC Life Insurance&nbsp;saw a 0.9 percent YoY decline in new premiums for June 2020 to Rs 1,346.68 crore.  ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, however, saw a 37 percent YoY decline in new premiums to Rs 564.56 crore. The Kotak report said that the insurer saw a higher decline than peers due to a likely slowdown in Ulips, with a 35 percent YoY drop in average ticket size to Rs 58,974 in individual regular business in June.  &amp;amp;nbsp;    On the one hand, while bank-led insurance sales have started picking up, the insurance industry is still waiting for the individual agents&rsquo; field visits to resume.  Field agents account for 40-45 percent of the total life insurance business every year but the lockdown has made it impossible for them to travel.  &ldquo;Even though the lockdown has been partially lifted and insurance falls under essential services, agents don&rsquo;t have access to public transport. Also, resident welfare associations are not allowing entry of agents,&rdquo; said the head of channel sales at a private insurer.  The June quarter is usually the slowest month as far as life insurance sales are concerned. Policy sales start picking from the onset of the festive season and shows the maximum growth during the fourth quarter.  &amp;amp;nbsp;","Business, coronavirus, Economy, insurance","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/m-saraswathy-6837/', 'name': 'M Saraswathy'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/bright-spots-emergelife-insurance-sector-amidst-covid-19-lockdown_14032741.html

The company witnessed strong loan growth performance, improved granularity of deposits and its growth, and expanded RoA led by strong fee income growth. On the other hand, asset quality weakened slightly with high net slippages (excl. lumpy accounts) ratio (+30bp YoY to 2.07%) and increase in write-offs (+70bp YoY to 1.7%). GNPL / PCR remained stable at 1.6%/60% YoY. BAF delivered healthy NII/PPoP/PAT growth of 39%/46%/32% in the year. Credit cost increased from 1.6% to 3.1% due to Covid-19 related provisions (2.5% ex-COVID related provisions) and write-offs of some large accounts. On the business front, BAF saw sharp moderation in new customer addition of +6% YoY to 8.7m, which is concerning. Overall, number of loans distributed declined from 50% YoY levels over the past three fiscals to 17% YoY in FY20. Customer base growth slowed down from 30% YoY levels earlier to 24% in FY20. Cross-selling for new origination increased from 65% in FY19 to ~70% in FY20. BAF has done well on two fronts - deposits and fee income. Deposit growth was in line with prior years at 60%+. Importantly, granular public deposit base grew 90%+ YoY with near doubling of depositors to 362k. Fee income grew 54% YoY to INR26b, driven by all categories, especially distribution income. Fees to assets improved to 2.0% from 1.7% in FY19 and 1.1% in FY18, driving RoA expansion. In line with current macros and the evolving pandemic situation, we expect share of rural business (9% of AUM) to rise sharply in FY21. A high share of BAF's business comes from metro cities; post the initial pent-up demand, we are yet to see signs of growth sustaining. Improvement in the moratorium rate from 27% in April to 16% in June is a key positive - though we await details on bounce rate.  Outlook In our recent note, we have upgraded EPS estimates by ~15% for FY21/FY22E driven by lower credit costs and better growth expectation.

These are likely to drive the strongest topline growth since FY12 (18.3% in FY21E) and the highest PAT growth since FY16 (38% in FY21E). - However, this extraordinary earnings growth in FY21 presents a significant hurdle from an FY22/FY23 perspective as none of these factors present a structural positive. Furthermore, material costs could result in high volatility in earnings for BRIT - it has one of the lowest gross margins among peers (40% in FY20). - While we like the structural story, expensive valuations (47.5x FY22), sustained concerns of elevated group inter-corporate deposits (ICDs) at around INR6b (similar to 4QFY20 when they crossed their own stated threshold of INR5b), and an uncertain earnings outlook beyond FY21 have led us to maintain our Neutral rating.

Since the future is uncertain for the next six to nine months, the company will give priority on the core products, and less focus will be on innovation, Berry said.  According to him, the rural demand was not affected by the coronavirus pandemic and it will continue to grow at a higher pace than urban.  Berry said the COVID-19 crisis will cause permanent changes in consumer behaviour, and home consumption will increase.  &amp;quot;During the first quarter, the company has been able to unlock efficiencies and prioritised on high gross margin and premium products,&amp;quot; he said.

Benign growth (12%YoY) and higher credit costs guidance (110% increase YoY) for FY21 is less perturbing given healthy PPoP (Q1FY21: 25%YoY/7%YoY:FY21), liquidity buffers (19% of liabilities) and capital sufficiency (Tier I: 23%, total CAR:26%).  Outlook Against this backdrop, we marginally prune down our growth estimates (12% vs 15% earlier) but maintain elevated NPA/credit costs estimates at 3%+/4% respectively for FY21. Capital and liquidity sufficiency should enable BAF to participate in consumption rebound sooner, hence we envisage robust 24% RoE and 4%RoA; subsequently our EPS estimates stand tweaked by 8-10% over FY21-23.

90,2020-07-25 10:46:51+05:30,Bajaj Finance Ltd.,BAJFINANCE,Rahul Bajaj has shown the way for Indian business family patriarchs,"Even as many Indian businessmen flamed out following ill-thought through forays into disparate businesses, the Bajaj patriarch stuck to knitting through the company&rsquo;s healthy balance sheet and allowing it to constantly explore related opportunities.","Note:&nbsp;Replugging this column after Rahul Bajaj resigned as the chairman of Bajaj Auto on April 29, 2021.  For a man who is believed to have said &ldquo;Only fools retire&rdquo;, Rahul Bajaj&rsquo;s stepping down as chairman of Bajaj Finance may seem a bit odd. Still sprightly at 82 and sharp as ever, will the man who turned his fledgling family business into&nbsp;Humara Bajaj, be content with a seat at the family dining table?  The release from the company was carefully worded: &ldquo;Rahul Bajaj, non-executive chairman of the company, having been at the helm since its inception in 1987 and the group for over five decades, as part of succession planning, has decided to demit the office&rdquo;.  The reference to succession planning holds the key not just to this decision but also the man&rsquo;s singular achievement that goes beyond just the numbers.  Indeed, Rahul Bajaj&rsquo;s single biggest accomplishment might have been the smooth transfer of his power to his sons and then in turn the bifurcation of business interests between the two of them.  No stranger to simmering discontent between siblings which in the past led to a bitter parting with his own brother, last year, he engineered a family settlement with his cousins, Shekhar, Madhur and Niraj, that laid down the terms of joint ownership of group companies along with a formal process to handle any future conflicts.  Plan this way  What&rsquo;s more, he has also made sure that his sons are free from any such tensions.  With that the senior Bajaj has laid out a perfect template for Indian business families on how they can enhance value from one generation to another.  Defying the unwritten rules of Indian business families, it is the fourth generation of the Bajaj family, led by Rajiv and Sanjiv, which has grown the empire the most and created enormous shareholder wealth in the bargain.  Today, three Bajaj group firms, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv and Bajaj Auto rank among the 35 most valuable companies in the country.  It was in 1968 that Rahul Bajaj took over the small family business of scooters, cement and electrical appliances from his father Kamalnayan Bajaj who in turn had inherited it from his father Jamnalal Bajaj whose contribution to India&rsquo;s freedom struggle far exceeds that to Indian business.  Through the 1970s and 1980s, Rahul Bajaj turned the company into a household name stretching the business to the limits permitted by the asphyxiating license-permit raj of the era.  When liberalisation came, the feisty, outspoken business leader was among those who raised their voice against the sudden assault of foreign capital and technology and asked for no more than a level playing field.  Soon enough though, the canny businessman figured out the new rules of the game and played it better than most. By the late 90s, Bajaj Auto was once again king of the Indian roads.  But here&rsquo;s where Rahul Bajaj departed from the time-honoured script for successful patriarchs. He knew when it was time for him to step back. With both his sons having apprenticed long enough on the shop floor, the man who had built the company into a two-wheeler giant transitioned smoothly into a mentor and guide, leaving operational control to them.  A good call  It was a wise and ultimately enriching decision.  Rajiv, the elder of the two and the appointed heir to the two-wheeler business, steered it out of a mini-slump following the onslaught of motorcycles in which arch-rival Hero Honda took the lead.  Soon though Bajaj had recovered lost ground and in 2009, the company took the momentous, though at that time highly, questionable decision to exit the scooters business. Subsequent events show that what the company lost on market share it made up in profitability.  But it is the newer business of financial services that has proved to be a bonanza for the group.  Outspoken and frank in public, Rahul Bajaj is anything but reckless in his business. Even as many Indian businessmen flamed out following ill-thought through forays into disparate businesses, Bajaj stuck to knitting through the company&rsquo;s &nbsp;healthy balance sheet, allowing it to constantly explore related opportunities. Financial services were an integral part of that diversification strategy.  Though the entry into this business was largely Rahul Bajaj&rsquo;s idea (in 2001, the company signed up with Allianz SE to start a general insurance business) he left it to Sanjiv to grow it the way he thought best.  To Sanjiv&rsquo;s credit after 10 years learning the ropes of the two-wheeler business, his ability to make a success of the financial business turning Bajaj Finance into one of the largest retail asset financing NBFCs in the country, is a remarkable feat.  Just as the evolution from the Bajaj Chetak to the Pulsar bike marks a generational shift in the group&rsquo;s two-wheeler business, the emergence of a powerful financial services entity whose market cap dwarfs that of the original entity Bajaj Auto marks an equally successful diversification.  In both these, Rahul Bajaj provided the ballast and more significantly the original impetus by empowering his sons at the right time and giving them distinct lines of business to run.

The volume dip of 40% was better than our expectation given 45 days business loss. We believe trade (distributor, retailers) inventory would have depleted during lockdown despite retail shops staying closed. Preferred pack buying over loose cigarettes also helped restore volumes. These factors would have helped company to re-fill trade pipeline given manufacturing &amp;amp;amp; supply chain operations normalised in June. The trade normally holds 14 days inventory. Comparable FMCG sales grew 12.2% with strong demand in staples, packages foods &amp;amp;amp; hygiene product and steep decline in discretionary &amp;amp;amp; stationary businesses. Operating margins contracted 1184 bps mainly impacted by negative operating leverage &amp;amp;amp; excise hike earlier in budget. Net profit de-grew 26.2%. Outlook With the end of capex cycle in most businesses (except FMCG), we believe capital allocation has been rationalised. With more than Rs 20,000 crore of cash &amp;amp;amp; liquid investment and consistent free cash flow generation of Rs 10,000-12000 crore, we expect Rs 20/share including special dividend in FY21E.

The company saw sequential improvement in cigarette revenue with marginal sales in April, 30-35% YoY decline in May and a strong recovery in June. However, the last 10 days have been challenging due to the return of lockdowns. FMCG showed strong momentum as the company saw a comparable growth of 12% YoY, with 34% YoY growth in staples, convenience foods and health &amp;amp;amp; hygiene (75% of the portfolio). The growth was led by packaged foods (biscuits, atta, and noodles) and hygiene products. We expect the FMCG momentum to sustain, at a slightly lower growth rate.

However, EBITDA and PAT were disappointing due to (a) estimated 37% cigarette volume decline, (b) far lower contribution of the highly profitable cigarette business to total sales (32% in 1QFY21 v/s usual levels of ~40%), and (c) massive losses in the hospitality business (~8% negative impact on EBITDA in 1QFY21 v/s 1% usual positive contribution). Our channel checks indicate that cigarette volumes are close to pre-COVID levels. However, re-imposition of lockdowns in a few states could have some negative effect. Nevertheless, it is unlikely for the (a) weak mix in 1QFY21 (low cigarette proportion to total sales) to be repeated, and (b) impact on margins to be as sharp as in 1QFY21. Outlook Further, outlook for the hotel business is still extremely hazy, which should lead to some profitability impact.

Importantly, commentary on recovery sustaining is also reasonably strong. -Despite healthy volume growth, earnings growth has been weak for several years now, which is likely to continue going ahead. Nevertheless, the likelihood of sharp earnings decline, as feared earlier, may not materialize. Therefore, it is possible that APNT, unlike other discretionary peers, would emerge relatively unscathed from the COVID-19 crisis. With better than expected recovery, APNT continues to remain market leader in a category with attractive long term potential. Hence, we upgrade our rating from Sell to Neutral.

99,2020-07-28 19:35:51+05:30,Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd.,APOLLOHOSP,Apollo Hospitals expects half its OPD consultations moving virtual within 3 years,"Apollo, which was carrying out 10,000-plus teleconsultations per day during pre-COVID days, has seen a jump of 300 percent. Another initiative of the healthcare chain, Apollo 24|7, plans to be an aggregator by including doctors from even non-Apollo networks.","Apollo Telehealth, the telemedicine division of India's largest private healthcare chain Apollo Hospitals, expects 50 percent of its outpatient department (OPD) consultations to go virtual in three years.  &ldquo;At present, 15 percent OPD consultations are so. Our plan is to make it 50 percent,&amp;quot; said Vikram Thaploo, Chief Executive Officer, TeleHealth, Apollo Hospitals, in an interview to Moneycontrol.  &amp;quot;Look at leading US healthcare provider Kaiser Permanente. They are already doing 70-75 percent OPD consultations virtually; ten years back, it was 25 percent,&amp;quot; Thaploo said.  Telemedicine allows healthcare professionals to evaluate, diagnose and treat patients using telecommunications technology &ndash; from phone calls to video, chat platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Mobile App, Skype, email and fax.  One of the major reasons for the tepid response towards it in India has been the lack of clarity over informed consent. The ground has now been cleared, with the government releasing the Telemedicine Practice Guidelines in March, just weeks after the country was hit by COVID-19.  As per the guidelines, if a patient initiates telemedicine consultation, consent is implied. These guidelines have been in the making for 10 years, Thaploo said.  Inflection point  &ldquo;While people were aware about the power of telemedicine, the avalanche effect came only because of COVID-19,&amp;quot; he said.  Apollo, which was carrying out 10,000-plus teleconsultations per day during pre-COVID-19 days, has seen a jump of 300 percent. In fact, Apollo Hospitals, which had to scale down its non-emergency OPD operations due to COVID-19, managed to stem the tide by offering virtual services.  Thaploo says there isn't much difference in the pricing of physical and virtual consultation.  Apollo Telehealth has 1,000 dedicated doctors for virtual consultations. The division also runs point-of-care centres to deliver healthcare services across Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and other states as part of Public-Private Partnerships, in addition to providing consultation to corporates.  Apollo TeleHealth Foundation has launched a toll-free call service, Sanjeevani Telehealth Seva, for non-COVID patients in Bhopal and Indore as many hospitals have suspended OPDs.  Omnichannels  Apollo has floated Apollo 24|7, an end-to-end omni-channel healthcare platform, to enable users from any part of the country to avail Apollo services over phone.  The platform currently offers a full bouquet of services such 24x7 consultation with Apollo doctors pan-India and across 55 specialities, medicine delivery at home, diagnostic test booking, doorstep sample collection, digital health records and more.  Thaploo says Apollo 24|7 plans be an aggregator by including doctors from even non-Apollo networks. A lot of start-ups and even telecom giants like Reliance Jio are betting big on digital healthcare service now.  &ldquo;When there is competition, we'll get better quality and price. From a corporate point of view, it makes you much smarter. We will beef up our services. If our quality is 99.9 percent, we'll try and make it 100 percent. The most important part about competition would be that as our chairman (Pratap Reddy) keeps saying, &lsquo;you increase the size of the pie, your size will also increase,&amp;quot; Thaploo said.","Business, Companies, coronavirus, Health & Fitness","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/viswanath-pilla-6848/', 'name': 'Viswanath Pilla'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/apollo-hospitals-expects-half-its-opd-consultations-moving-virtual-within-3-years_14092301.html

Nil treasury gains impacted overall PPoP. Loan growth declined YoY by 2% (7% QoQ) and has been a key dampener for NIM (down 30 bps QoQ), apart from surplus liquidity.

Total COVID-19 related provisions stood at 0.6% of advances for the bank. Despite weak loan growth, continued moderation in CoF supports NII growth.

The domestic sales growth was 2.6% while exports de-grew 9.3%. We believe supply in April was normal only for milk products &amp;amp;amp; all other categories witnessed resumption of manufacturing in slow &amp;amp;amp; gradual manner. The quarter witnessed a strong growth in &lsquo;Everyday&rsquo;, &lsquo;Nestl&eacute; a+&rsquo; &amp;amp;amp; &lsquo;Milkmaid&rsquo; mainly due to very high sales in initial weeks of April. We believe the company anticipated large scale disruption in milk supply or shift in consumer demand from pouch to powder &amp;amp;amp; UHT Milk. However, pouch milk supply disruption did not last longer than few weeks, resulting in piling up of &lsquo;Everyday&rsquo; inventory at the end of distributors. We believe milk products would see inventory rationalisation at the distributor level given demand conditions from hotels, restaurants &amp;amp;amp; airline remain muted. Operating profit saw growth of 7.2% with margins expanding 127 bps. The margin expansion was led by cost cutting measures &amp;amp;amp; reduction in A&amp;amp;amp;P spend (overhead spends down 487 bps) partially offset by the 193 bps contraction in gross margins. Given the reduction in corporate tax rate, net profit increased 11.1% to Rs 486.6 crore (I-direct estimate : Rs 502.7 crore). Notably, e-com channel sales grew by 122% contributing now 3.6% of sales.

Ever since the coronavirus outbreak in India and the subsequent lockdown from March 25, this is the first month that life insurers have seen a growth in first year premium collection.  Data from Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) showed that, while for the April 1 to July 31 period the life insurers saw a 12 percent YoY decline in premium to Rs 72,321.53 crore, July was an outlier.  In the industry, private insurers saw a 26 percent YoY growth in first-year premium collection to Rs 7,815.14 crore in July 2020. Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) saw a flat premium (decline of 0.9 percent YoY) of Rs 15,170.95 crore.  Among the listed insurers, HDFC Life Insurance posted a 40.8 percent YoY increase in new premium to Rs 1,975.75 crore. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance saw a 10 percent YoY decline in new premiums to Rs 848.74 crore. SBI Life Insurance saw a 42 percent YoY rise in first-year premium to Rs 1,909.03 crore in July 2020.    The first-year premium collection data for July 2020 showed that all bank-led insurers started seeing positive growth. This is amidst an easing of the lockdown across India and more customers walking into bank branches.  Since March, life insurers have been seeing a double-digit decline in new premiums. In March, there was a 32 percent YoY decline in first-year premium.  In April 2020, the decline was at 32.6 percent. Life insurers' new premiums saw a 25.4 percent YoY decline in May 2020 while in June 2020 life insurers saw a 10.5 percent decline in new premiums compared to a year-ago.  Bank-led players see growth in premiums  For July, IndiaFirst Life Insurance that has Bank of Baroda and Andhra Bank (now merged with Union Bank of India) as the bank promoters saw a 251.2 percent YoY growth in new premium to Rs 385.87 crore.  Star Union Dai-ichi Life Insurance that has Bank of India and Union Bank as its Indian promoters saw a 109.3 percent YoY growth in new premium to Rs 85.4 crore in July.  Another life insurer, Canara HSBC OBC Life that has Canara Bank, HSBC and Oriental Bank of Commerce (now merged with Punjab National Bank) also saw a 20.7 percent YoY growth in premium to Rs 111 crore in July.

Strong 310bps EBITDA margin improvement to 17.9% led by better realizations, lower trade spends, better product and channel mix, utilization of low priced RM inventory and lower discretionary expenditure across key cost heads. Management highlighted some tapering off in the demand momentum and also the margin risks on account of a 50% rise in India tea prices; integration between foods and beverages business should complete by end-CY20 with expected synergy benefits of 1.5%-2% over 18-24 months and a 100bps reduction in distribution costs post completion of supply chain initiatives. Results were a significant beat on our and consensus estimates with more than expected surge in demand due to pantry stocking across markets coupled with strong execution and lesser promotion and other spends.

SUNP&rsquo;s own generic business was flat qoq. India growth of +3% yoy beat our estimate of a 3% decline (chronic skew aided). Opex cut in Q1 is unlikely to sustain as marketing activity picks up from Q2 onward. With a slow ramp-up in the specialty portfolio, we expect limited margin expansion in the interim due to generic competition in Absorica (Dec&rsquo;20), increase in India field force (by around 10%) and increase in R&amp;amp;amp;D spends.

132,2020-08-11 07:19:13+05:30,Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.,SUNPHARMA,"Hot Stocks | Here's why Sun Pharma, Tata Power and Hindalco are a buy for short term","The benchmark index is just a few points away from the recent top of 11,341 which also happens to be the highest point of the rally started since March 2020.","  Vinay Rajani  Nifty has been rising for the last five consecutive sessions. On August 11, it added 0.50 percent to its upswing and closed at 11,270.  The benchmark index is just a few points away from the recent top of 11,341, which also happens to be the highest point of the rally started since March 2020.  In the previous week, Nifty resumed its uptrend after finding support at 200-days SMA, placed at 10,880-odd level.  Nifty Auto, Metal and Pharma indices have taken the lead in the recent recovery. Nifty smallcap index has been rising for the last seven sessions on the trot.  So far in the month, NSE Midcap and Smallcap indices have outperformed the Nifty with a huge margin.  Nifty has got stiff resistance around 11,350, which is derived from the upward sloping trendline, adjoining the bottoms of October 2018 and September 2019 on the weekly and monthly charts.  The resistance of 11,350 is not that far from the current levels. The recent bottom of 10,882 is expected to act as further support. Immediate support comes in at 11,000.  Nifty is placed above its 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200-DMA, which indicates a bullish trend.  Any level above 11,350 could result in further short-covering in Nifty, which could push the levels towards 11,500-11,550 immediately.  Bank Nifty has been trading in the range of 21,300-22,000. Breakout from this range would decide the trend for the Bank Nifty further.  Above 22,000, Bank Nifty could witness a sharp short-covering. Longs should be held with 21,300 stop loss.  On the intraday charts, the index has formed eve and eve double bottom at 21,300-21,400 levels, which indicates the chances of a bullish breakout.  The market is in the continuation of an uptrend. Remaining long with trailing stop loss would be the better strategy in the days to come.  Mid and small-caps from auto, auto ancillary, pharma and metals sectors should do well in the coming days.  Levels below 10,882 would confirm the bearish trend reversal for Nifty, but till then, the view should remain bullish.  Here are three buy calls for the next 3-4 weeks:  Sun Pharma | Buy | LTP: Rs 544.10 | Target price: Rs 600 | Stop loss: Rs 510 | Upside: 10%  The stock has broken out from the last six session's price consolidation with rising volumes.  In July, it confirmed the long-term downward sloping trendline breakout on the monthly chart.  The stock is placed above all important moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.  Tata Power | Buy | LTP: Rs 51.60 | Target price: Rs 57 | Stop loss: Rs 48.50 | Upside: 10%  The stock has broken out from the symmetrical triangle on the daily charts. For the last one month, it has been finding support on its 200-days EMA.  It has also surpassed the double top resistance placed at Rs 51.55 odd levels. Volumes have also gone up along with the price breakout.  Hindalco Industries | Buy | LTP: Rs 178.60 | Target price: Rs 194 | Stop loss: Rs 170 | Upside: 9%  The metal sector has been outperforming for the last two weeks. On August 5, the stock broke out from the bullish flag pattern on the daily chart.  For the last three sessions, the stock has been consolidating in a small range with bullish candles. The stock has been forming higher tops and higher bottoms on the daily and weekly charts.

Excluding bullion sale, revenue for the division fell 71% YoY (grammage de-growth: 81%) with sales in May, June around 20%, 72%, respectively. The company is expecting recovery rate to improve at 80% of pre-Covid levels by end of Q2FY21. The impact of pandemic was much more severe on the watches division as the segment reported revenue de-growth of 90% YoY to Rs 75.0 crore. Sales continued to remain under stress, with a recovery rate of 40% in July. Revenue from eyewear division de-grew 80% YoY to Rs 30.0 crore. Overall consolidated revenue de-grew 62% YoY to Rs 1979.0 crore. Gross margins deteriorated 550 bps YoY to 22.0% owing to lower share of studded ratio (18% vs. 25% YoY) and higher demand for plain gold jewellery. Despite sharp reduction in advertising spend (down 86% YoY), profitability in the quarter was materially impacted due to other expenses staying elevated (certain expenses pertaining to ineffective hedge that Titan did not quantify). Hence, EBITDA losses were at Rs 253.0 crore. Currently, ~97% of stores are operational and management has reiterated its stance of achieving normalcy levels by Q4FY21E.  Outlook Robust balance sheet and asset light distribution model have enabled Titan to outperform peers.

141,2020-08-12 18:47:29+05:30,ITC Ltd.,ITC,FMCG Q1 Review: The quarter of health and hygiene products,"There was a rising trend of &lsquo;at-home&rsquo; as opposed to &lsquo;out-of-home&rsquo; consumption. Apart from a thrift mindset, consumers were preferring larger pack formats as they seek to reduce the frequency of purchase","The coronavirus pandemic has completely changed life as we know it.&nbsp;The fear of catching the infection has also led us&nbsp;to adopt a more healthy&nbsp;and hygienic lifestyle.  The shift in&nbsp;trend clearly reflected in&nbsp;the first-quarter performance&nbsp;of FMCG&nbsp; companies such as ITC, Hindustan Unilever,&nbsp; Marico, Dabur, and Britannia.  With health &amp;amp;amp; hygiene categories in focus, discretionary categories were on the slow lane.  The other theme that showed promise for Indian FMCG players was rural demand. The rabi harvest was good, Kharif sowing was off to a great start, rural cash flows were looking up and the pandemic did not wreak havoc in the rural areas. This optimism was reflected in the earnings of&nbsp;FMCG companies who also benefitted from benign raw material prices.  In terms of food items, there was a rising trend of &lsquo;at-home&rsquo; as opposed to &lsquo;out-of-home&rsquo; consumption. Apart from a thrift mindset, consumers were preferring larger pack formats as they seek to reduce the frequency of purchase.  Which products saw the highest demand?  India&rsquo;s FMCG major, ITC witnessed the demand for staples, noodles, biscuits, dairy, sanitisers, hand wash, and floor&nbsp;cleaners. On the other hand, discretionary categories and those with relatively higher salience of &lsquo;out-of-home&rsquo; consumption witnessed contraction.  The 'B Natural' range of juices particularly immunity range was met with encouraging response from discerning consumers.  Similarly, Hindustan Unilever saw the highest demand during the lockdown for coffee, sanitisers, deep cleaning, and Kissan products. HUL offers a prominent coffee brand, BRU, while sauces and jams fall under the brand Kissan.

Apart from a thrift mindset, consumers were preferring larger pack formats as they seek to reduce the frequency of purchase","The coronavirus pandemic has completely changed life as we know it.&nbsp;The fear of catching the infection has also led us&nbsp;to adopt a more healthy&nbsp;and hygienic lifestyle.  The shift in&nbsp;trend clearly reflected in&nbsp;the first-quarter performance&nbsp;of FMCG&nbsp; companies such as ITC, Hindustan Unilever,&nbsp; Marico, Dabur, and Britannia.  With health &amp;amp;amp; hygiene categories in focus, discretionary categories were on the slow lane.  The other theme that showed promise for Indian FMCG players was rural demand. The rabi harvest was good, Kharif sowing was off to a great start, rural cash flows were looking up and the pandemic did not wreak havoc in the rural areas. This optimism was reflected in the earnings of&nbsp;FMCG companies who also benefitted from benign raw material prices.  In terms of food items, there was a rising trend of &lsquo;at-home&rsquo; as opposed to &lsquo;out-of-home&rsquo; consumption. Apart from a thrift mindset, consumers were preferring larger pack formats as they seek to reduce the frequency of purchase.  Which products saw the highest demand?  India&rsquo;s FMCG major, ITC witnessed the demand for staples, noodles, biscuits, dairy, sanitisers, hand wash, and floor&nbsp;cleaners. On the other hand, discretionary categories and those with relatively higher salience of &lsquo;out-of-home&rsquo; consumption witnessed contraction.  The 'B Natural' range of juices particularly immunity range was met with encouraging response from discerning consumers.  Similarly, Hindustan Unilever saw the highest demand during the lockdown for coffee, sanitisers, deep cleaning, and Kissan products. HUL offers a prominent coffee brand, BRU, while sauces and jams fall under the brand Kissan.  Within deep cleaning, HUL offers products such as Domex under the home care category and Lifebuoy under skincare category.

Revenue from the copper business stood at Rs 3,031 crore in Q1 FY21 down by 34 percent due to lower volumes and realisation of both copper and by-products.

149,2020-08-14 16:46:44+05:30,Hindalco Industries Ltd.,HINDALCO,Hindalco MD says cautiously optimistic about demand rebound,"The continued recovery in demand in the coming quarters will be critical, said Satish Pai","  Hindalco Industries is cautiously optimistic of a demand rebound for its products as the economy begins to find its foot post the COVID-19 led lockdown.  While the second quarter has seen many of its customers resuming production, demand from auto and construction - excluding those driven by government spending - continue to lag, said Managing Director Satish Pai.  &amp;quot;Demand has picked up well in sectors such as packaging, industrials and pharmaceuticals. In auto, the two-wheeler segment is doing well,&amp;quot; Pai said, during the conference on August 14.  Better demand will help the aluminium major improve upon its first-quarter performance. Hindalco reported a net loss of Rs 40 crore on a standalone basis for June quarter as revenue was hit by COVID-19-led lockdown.&nbsp;The company had reported profit at Rs 23 crore for June quarter 2019.  Standalone revenue in Q1 FY21 declined 26.2 percent to Rs 7,420 crore compared to the same period last year.  Weak domestic demand had seen the company exporting 80 percent of its production in the first quarter. This should come down to 60 percent in the second quarter, said Pai.  The company had continued to operate its smelters at 90 percent capacity during the lockdown, helping it to ship products overseas. At the same time, &nbsp;the inventory remains high and a better domestic demand will be critical to bringing it down.  Globally, a sharp rebound in China - the largest consumer of the metal - has helped prices trend higher. A Reuters report said&nbsp;Fitch Solutions has&nbsp;revised its three-month LME aluminium average price forecast for 2020 to $1,690 a tonne from $1,600 earlier.  Pai noted that the prices were moving up because of better sentiment, especially driven by the demand from the Chinese market, where auto sales have recovered smartly. &amp;quot;The prices are right now driven by sentiment, and not by fundamentals of aluminium demand and supply,&amp;quot; Pai said.  Capex plans  On a consolidated basis, Hindalco reported a loss of Rs 709 crore, as compared to a profit of Rs 1,063 crore in the same period last year. This was because of exceptional expenses including those related to the Aleris acquisition by Novelis, the North American unit of Hindalco.  Novelis completed the acquisition of Aleris on April 14, 2020, and the integration process has begun, Hindalco said.  &amp;quot;&nbsp;Q1 consolidated PAT for continuing businesses before tax-effected exceptional and special items stood at Rs 139 crore. On account of certain special items &mdash; including charitable contributions towards COVID relief, ex-gratia paid to employees for their contribution during COVID, and Aleris acquisition costs &mdash; the reported PAT was impacted. The company, as a consequence, reported a loss of Rs. 709 crore for the quarter. This also includes Rs 140 crore loss attributed to operations of Novelis (Lewisport and Duffel) that are in the process of divestiture,&amp;quot; the company said in a statement.  On capital expenditure for the year, Pai said while Hindalco's outlay of Rs 1,500 crore for the year will continue, Novelis has reduced it by $50 million. &amp;quot;Novelis had earlier planned a capex of $500 million. Now, along with Aleris, the capex has been revised to $450 million,&amp;quot; Pai said.","Business, Companies, Covid-19, Hindalco","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/hindalco-md-says-cautiously-optimistic-about-demand-rebound_14174461.html

154,2020-08-16 15:05:07+05:30,Hindalco Industries Ltd.,HINDALCO,Coronavirus triggers once-in-a-century crisis; economy may shrink in FY21: Kumar Mangalam Birla,"This year will see an economic contraction, but this 2020 recession is likely to be one of the shortest, assuming no second wave of the pandemic recurs, says Kumar Mangalam Birla","A once-in-a-century crisis for the society and the economy triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns may shrink India's gross domestic product (GDP) in FY21, said Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman of Hindalco Industries.  Birla said COVID-19 hit India at a time when the underlying economic conditions were suppressed on account of heightened global uncertainty and stress in the domestic financial system.  &amp;quot;It is estimated that about 80 per cent of India's GDP originates from districts which were classified under red and orange zones during the lockdown, where economic activity remained severely constrained. Correspondingly, India's GDP is likely to contract in FY21, which would be the first such instance in over four decades,&amp;quot; Birla said in a letter to shareholders.  Given the fog of uncertainty all around, it is hard to be prescient in these times, Birla said.  A stringent national lockdown to slow the spread of coronavirus started in the last week of FY20 and remained active to varying degrees in different geographies through most of the first quarter of FY21.  &amp;quot;But there is little doubt on one reality: companies with quality leadership, sound business fundamentals, and a track record of winning in turbulent times, will emerge as champions in the new global order,&amp;quot; he said.  This year will see an economic contraction, but this 2020 recession is turning out very different from the past recessions, Birla said.  &amp;quot;It has been too sudden &ndash; almost off the cliff; its spread has been all-encompassing &ndash;affecting almost every economy and sector, and the plunge in economic activity levels and employment has been unprecedented,&amp;quot; he said.  On the positive side, this recession is likely to be one of the shortest, assuming no second wave of the pandemic recurs.  As present lockdowns around the world get lifted, and businesses reopen, economic activity is likely to bounce back fairly quickly, he said.  &amp;quot;Around $9-trillion stimulus from different governments globally will help to support this recovery, along with the monetary actions by central banks. These policies will also help to restrict the second-order effects like defaults and bankruptcies,&amp;quot; Birla said.  Some scars of the crisis will remain in the form of subdued consumer and business confidence. Some sectors, like airlines and hospitality, will take time to recover fully. And some supply chain disruption effects will linger. As the world emerges from the current crisis, the next few years are likely to be marked by lack of buoyancy in growth, subdued commodity prices and inflation, a cautious trend in project investments, heightened risks of de-globalisation and political uncertainty; and increased dependence of financial systems on ultra-loose monetary policy conditions, Birla said.  &amp;quot;We will also have to watch out for potential post-COVID changes in consumer behaviour (such as more virtual engagements) and of operating models of organisations (such as work-from-home norms, diversification of supply chain risks, more use of e-commerce),&amp;quot; he said.

Enquiries and booking are almost back to pre-covid level for RE, however production was severely impacted due to frequent lockdowns in Chennai, affecting availability of products. Strong demand was witnessed in Tier 2/3 cities and rural areas, while demand in larger cities is still weak. Outstanding order-book is at ~45k units and channel inventory stands at 10K vehicles (1 week only). We expect the company's strategic interventions around product (RE plans to launch a new product every quarter) &amp;amp;amp; market expansion (underpenetrated states), digital focus, upgrade demand for Twins 650 cc and export ramp up should enable sharp volume growth in FY22. We expect margin improve from 2HFY21 due to benefit of operating leverage and cost control measures. We believe the long term margin is likely to be in the range of 23-25% as benefit of operating leverage would be partially offset by launch cost, increasing competitive intensity and reversal in commodity prices. Outlook We retain our positive view on EIM, due to the pick-up in order-bookings, strong product pipeline and network expansion. However, valuation (28/23x for FY22/23E EPS) looks expensive.

Miss on NII (decline in NIM) was made up by cost containment (driven partially by structural measures). Additional covid-related prov. of Rs9.6bn weighed on earnings, while asset quality was stable due to standstill. Cumulative covid buffer at Rs18.7bn (1.7% of on-book AUM). Conservative built-up of prov. also reflected in ECL cover of 39% on Stage-3 assets and 3.7% on Stage 1&amp;amp;amp;2 assets. 71% and 73% of borrowers paid in June and July respectively. However, collection efficiency was lower at 50-55% as many customers paid partial installments. Management believes many such customers are retaining cash for lockdown uncertainty or to support business operations. Collection trends are expected to improve in August and September. After moratorium ends, the company will deploy its usual recovery methods (including repo threat) which should drive-up collections. In worst case, management sees restructuring requirement for 5-10% of borrowers. No further additional prov. requirement seen if covid situation does not worsen; implying normalization of credit cost in H2. While excess liquidity will be carried for a while, NIM is expected to improve by Q4 FY21 with easing incremental funding cost. Extant BS liquidity (Rs97bn), unused bank lines (Rs20bn), branch activation for deposits, improving funding availability and rising collections place SHTF comfortably for meeting liability repayments and business requirements. Notwithstanding that SHTF caters to riskier customers segment (owner-drivers), company&rsquo;s covid buffer stands higher than peers, thus cushions future P&amp;amp;amp;L outcomes.

European operations reported steel sales of 2.0 MT, marginally higher than our estimate of 1.9 MT. Tata Steel BSL reported sales volume of 0.7 MT (higher than our estimate of 0.65 MT).

Today, insurance, specifically life and health covers, has become a necessity, he said.  &amp;quot;Global trends reflect that insurance and financial planning are among people&rsquo;s top priorities in such a crisis,&rdquo; he told BestMediaInfo.com.  Gupta said HDFC Life has witnessed an improvement in the number of policies sold, as well as the average ticket size for the protection business, in the first quarter of FY21.  &amp;quot;There is an increased awareness around the need for protection and the inadequacy of the insurance coverage that people currently have. This has led to a surge in the demand for term insurance, and we believe that the trend is likely to sustain,&amp;quot; he said.  Track this LIVE blog for all the latest updates on coronavirus pandemic  The business has started to pick up on a month-on-month basis, and we are seeing higher traction, especially in the individual protection business, he added.  Speaking about the company's communication strategy, which had to change due to the pandemic, Gupta said genuine empathy for customers is very important.  &ldquo;In the initial days, our role was to ensure that we remain relevant by engaging with our consumers and finding ways to assist them in taking the right financial decisions. Recently, we also launched a term insurance campaign to build awareness around the importance of protecting our loved ones in these uncertain times,&amp;quot; he said.  He further said it is important to have the right media mix to reach out to the right consumer.  &ldquo;Media buying and overall strategy need a relook due to the changes in consumer behaviour and consumption trends.

169,2020-08-20 10:47:12+05:30,Titan Company Ltd.,TITAN,Gold glitters but watches stop ticking for Titan,Titan CFO Subbu Subramaniam says customers are keen to buy gold jewellery despite the high prices that are prevailing. Hopes for recovery by Q4 of FY21 but expects numbers for the full year to be hit badly by the pandemic.,"Gold&rsquo;s glitter seems to be taking the sheen off the diamond. Despite high gold prices, Titan has witnessed robust demand for gold jewellery, leaving behind woman&rsquo;s best friend.  Diamonds are clearly not in favour as such, Subramaniam, Chief Financial Officer,&nbsp;Titan Company Ltd, told Moneycontrol&nbsp;in a telephonic interaction. Most customers who used to buy diamonds earlier are looking at buying gold at this point, he added.  &ldquo;People are looking at buying gold more as a store of value, asset allocation and also as a safe haven. If you look at the stock market, people are wary of the market direction ahead; debt markets are yielding very low returns. Therefore, in the context of that, gold seem to be a safe-haven investment for most people,&rdquo; Subramaniam said.  Jewellery rules  On a like-to-like basis, Titan is looking at reporting at least 80 percent of last year&rsquo;s July revenue and is getting traction back in the jewellery segment. In August, so far, the company is ahead of last year, Subramaniam said, without revealing any numbers.  In Q2 (July-September) of FY20, Titan had reported revenue of Rs 3,528 crore against Rs 3,582 crore. Its jewellery business had done better than most players in the industry then.  Titan sells jewellery under the brand name Tanishq. The jewellery business is&nbsp;Titan's mainstay&nbsp;and accounted for 83 percent of its revenue in financial year 2020.  Apart from gold jewellery, Titan has also seen demand for gold coins in the past few months.  Gold seen as a safe haven  Since January 2020, gold prices have surged nearly 40 percent, tracking a rally in global rates and depreciation in the rupee against the US dollar.  Also, the rise in safe-haven demand and expectations that central banks and governments will maintain support for economies hit by the coronavirus have pushed gold prices to record highs.  On August 7, gold hit a record high of&nbsp;Rs 56,191 per 10 grams in the Mumbai bullion market. On August 19, the gold price closed at Rs 55,360 per 10 grams.  Subramaniam envisages gold prices will rise in the coming months and expects demand for gold jewellery to continue. The company will also open 20-30 new jewellery stores in the current financial year.&nbsp;  Down time  Titan suffered a loss in the quarter ended June as stores remained shut during the Covid-19 lockdown and consumers spent less on discretionary items.  The company said 83 percent of its stores had opened by the end of June. But even then, many were not operating on all days.  &ldquo;With the negative consumer sentiment prevailing in the quarter, discretionary spends were very low and specifically impacted our watches business,&rdquo; Subramaniam said.  The watches segment, which usually accounts for 12-15 percent of revenue for the company, was the worst hit as demand for the accessory drastically fell after the Covid outbreak. The segment recorded an 89 percent decline in revenue in the June quarter. The watches division comprises brands such as Fastrack, Sonata, Raga, Octane and Xylys.  Subramaniam indicated that demand for watches has not picked up in Q2 as well. Again, he did not share any numbers.  The disappointing earnings did not deter the company from launching new products. Titan announced the launch of its full-touch smartwatch &lsquo;Connected X&rsquo; on Amazon India during Prime Day on August 6. The product has garnered a good response so far, Subramaniam said.&nbsp;  Outlook  Subramaniam expressed concern that overall numbers by the end of FY21 will be hit badly due to the pandemic.  However, he was quick to add that at least by the fourth quarter (January-March) of FY21 things may start getting back to normal.  &ldquo;We may see a decline in our revenues for FY21 but hopefully by the fourth quarter, we may get into a sense of normalcy. So, FY22 should be a normal year with the hope that the vaccine will possibly come out by the end of this calendar year, which looks very, very probable now,&rdquo; Subramaniam said.  The company also slashed its advertising spend in Q1 of FY21 by 86 percent. Even in Q2, ad expenditure is likely to remain muted. Subramaniam said, adding: &ldquo;If the revenue starts ramping up from Q3 and Q4, we will increase ad spend.&amp;quot;  For the remaining quarters of&nbsp;FY21, Titan is pinning its hopes on a revival in demand during the festival season and weddings as people are likely to get used to the new normal.  &ldquo;The festive season should be decent as most people have been cooped up in their homes since March. They would want to go out, shop, explore and enjoy during Diwali and Christmas. Additionally, weddings, which were to take place in Q1 and Q2, are being pushed to Q3 and Q4 (of FY21).&nbsp; So, lots of occasions coming up for us to take advantage,&rdquo; he said.  Titan Company Ltd, a joint venture between the Tata Group and the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO), commenced operations in 1984 under the name Titan Watches Ltd. Titan is the fifth-largest integrated own-brand watch manufacturer in the world.","Business, jewellery, lockdown, Titan, watches","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/himadri-buch-6865/', 'name': 'Himadri Buch'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/gold-glitterswatches-stop-ticking-for-titan_14196441.html

","India's Hindalco Industries Ltd on&nbsp;August 20 signed an agreement with UltraTech Cement Ltd to supply 1.2 million tonnes of bauxite residue every year to be used as a raw material for cement, as part of its push for alternative methods of disposing of the toxic waste.  Hindalco, India's top aluminium and copper producer, said it would supply 2.5 million tonnes of bauxite residue, also known as red mud, to 40 cement companies this year, to help cement makers to replace their existing raw materials such as laterite, a mineral.

Responding to concerns raised by the company shareholders over a virtual AGM, Chandrasekaran said, &amp;quot;talks are not over.&amp;quot; He, however, underlined that the UK operations are not profitable and that it &amp;quot;continues to be a drag.&amp;quot;  The clarification comes days after reports emerged from the UK that the government there has refused to support its operations there. The two sides were in talks for possible financial assistance.  &amp;quot;The government concluded the Indian multinational was sufficiently financed and didn&rsquo;t qualify for taxpayer support,&amp;quot; the Financial Times reported.  The talks are critical for the future of the company's operations in the country. Its other major facility in Europe, located in the Netherlands has also faced problems in the form of protest from employees.  Apart from clarifying that the situation was not as described by reports, Chandrasekaran also played down the auditor's note, in the recently announced Q1 results, doubting if the UK operations can continue as a going concern.  The Tata Steel Chairman signalled that the auditor's note was more a regulatory requirement, and said, &amp;quot;Tata Sons and Tata Steel continue to do what is right.&amp;quot;  Tata Steel&nbsp;on August 13, had reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 4,648.13 crore for the June quarter of FY21.&nbsp;It&nbsp;had reported a loss of 1,615.35 crore in the March quarter and a profit of Rs 714.03 crore in the June quarter of FY20.  Talking about the European operations, Executive Director and CFO Koushik Chatterjee, said: &amp;quot;Tata Steel Europe's performance was affected by lower deliveries and a sharp decline in European spreads to an unsustainably low level. As a result, our consolidated adjusted EBITDA dropped to Rs 1,038 crore.&amp;quot;  At the AGM, Chandrasekaran said that the company is striving to find a solution in this fiscal year. &amp;quot;It could be matter of months before we have a decision. If it's not a successful outcome, we will be thinking about alternate options. We are looking for a solution that is lasting,&amp;quot; he said.  Change in geographical mix  Earlier, while addressing the shareholders, Chandrasekaran pointed out the change in the company's geographical mix.  &amp;quot;While earlier one-third of the business was in India, and was profitable, two-thirds was international and was not profitable. We have changed the mix. Now, two-thirds of the business is in India,&amp;quot; he said.  Over the years, the company has invested Rs 75,000 crore in the last four years to increase its India business. The investment included the Rs 35,000 crore it has spent on the new facility in Kalinganagar, in Odisha. The rest of the money has been used to acquire Bhushan Steel and Usha Martin.  Responding to shareholders concerns over the company debt, which stood at Rs, 1,04,779 as on March 2020, the Chairman said that the aim is to reduce this to Rs 75,000 crore, &amp;quot;as fast as possible.&amp;quot;","Business, Companies, Tata Steel","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/tata-steel-chairman-n-chandrasekaran-says-discussions-onuk-government-for-financial-aid_14199001.html

The Hyderabad-based company's Favipiravir version sold under brand name Favilow is priced at Rs 33 per tablet of 200 mg dosage. MSN's Favilow is two rupees cheaper than Sun Pharma's Favipiravir tablet which is priced at Rs 35.  As of now, a COVID-19 patient has to take 122 tablets 200-mg dosage of Favipiravir for 14 days. Favipiravir price has dropped close to 70 percent in less than two months, as more than a dozen companies have launched the medication.  With mounting competition, MSN said it is offering free home delivery of Favilow to patients suffering with mild to moderate COVID-19 across 170 cities.  &ldquo;Our efforts to come up with home delivery of the medicine are to help the patients with easy availability. Our teams are actively working with pharmacies across the country to make this feat possible,&rdquo; said Dr MSN Reddy, CMD of MSN Group.  MSN said it will soon be launching Favilow 400 mg in the market to reduce the pill burden. Currently Glenmark has 400 mg version.  Favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral, was originally developed by Toyama Chemical Co, a subsidiary of Japanese drugmaker Fujifilm. The drug was approved in Japan in 2014. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, doctors in China and Russia have started using it to treat COVID-19 patients.  The Drug Controller General of India in June approved the use of Glenmark's Favipiravir version for restricted emergency use in mild to moderate COVID-19 cases.  The increase in acceptance of the drug among doctors and rising COVID-19 cases are pushing pharma companies to boost Favipiravir production.  India has reported 2.27 million COVID-19 cases, and 54,849 deaths so far. The cases are rising at a fast pace in the country - more than 60,000 a day - with most cases coming from smaller towns and villages.  Pharma companies that are quick to spot the trend have jumped into the race to launch Favipiravir. More than a dozen drugmakers including the big ones such as Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy's, Cipla, Lupin and Alkem have launched generic versions of Favipiravir so far, and many more are in line to launch the drug.  As part of the COVID 19 treatment range, MSN has already launched Oseltamivir 75 mg capsules, another anti-viral medication.","Business, Companies, coronavirus, Health","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/viswanath-pilla-6848/', 'name': 'Viswanath Pilla'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/msn-labs-launches-favilowcheapest-favipiravir-drug-for-covid-19-at-rs-33-per-pill_14202601.html

Here are sectors which we believe investors should focus on and invest in after June quarter earnings session:  Life Insurance a sweet spot sector: Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) clocked a sharp 40 percent month-on-month growth in individual premiums in July and August, led by a jump in the sales of big-ticket pension and term assurance plans. We believe life insurance space in India has been gaining significant traction, with top private sector players delivering strong performances over the past two to three years. We expect private insurance companies like HDFC Life, SBI Life and ICICI Prudential Life could see the same traction in premium collection growth.  Defence sector stocks to be in action on the back of Atma Nirbhar Bharat boost: The procurements will focus on indigenous design and development. Platforms and equipment worth Rs 31,130 crore will be procured from Indian companies and they will be manufactured in India. In the last 5 years, India has spent Rs 3.5 trillion on import of defence items and expects the opportunities of Rs 4 trillion in next 5 years, hence defence stocks like Bharat Dynamics, Bharat Electronics, ZenTech, Cochin Shipyard, HAL and L&amp;amp;amp;T are set to benefit.  The real estate sector can see a boost in the coming quarter: The Centre makes a countrywide effort to push affordable housing and Maharashtra is considering reducing stamp duty on real estate from 5 percent to 2-3 percent in order to give a boost to the industry. The government recently appointed a committee, under the chairmanship of HDFC head Deepak Parekh, to make recommendations to boost the sector. One of its recommendations was to cut stamp duty by 50 percent. Realty &amp;amp;amp; building material stocks to be focused in coming quarters. We like Kolte-Patil, Godrej Properties, Sobha, Brigade Enterprises, Raymond, Ashiana Housing etc. Paints /Tiles stocks are also to follow the trend.  Government's move to build a better infrastructure sector: National Infrastructure Pipeline will ease COVID hit on the economy. Government has identified about 7,000 projects in different sectors that will be part of the National Infrastructure Pipeline. The National Infrastructure Pipeline will play a crucial role in resurrecting the country's economy from the impact of the corona outbreak and the country is going to spend more than Rs 100 lakh crore on this. Hence we are bullish on stocks such as Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro, Ashoka buildcon, Dilip Buildcon, KEC International and KNR Construction.  The author is AVP Research at Mehta Equities.

The Tata group FMCG firm is shifting its focus on innovation also and is targeting to double the contribution from new products.  Besides, it is rebuilding its core business, creating capacity and is realising synergies from the integration of its food and beverage businesses in India.  Under its growth plans, Tata Consumer Products Ltd (TCPL), which recently bought out its JV partner PepsiCo in NourishCo Beverages, is also exploring both organic and inorganic opportunities in the segment.  &ldquo;Our growth plans for FY21 will focus on executing our strategic plans, which includes building on our core businesses, jump shifting digital and innovation, realising synergies from the integration of our food &amp;amp;amp; beverage businesses in India, stepping up our capability building agenda, exploring new opportunities organic and inorganic,&rdquo; TCPL Managing Director &amp;amp;amp; CEO Sunil D'Souza told PTI.  TCPL is making its entire distribution system to be more &amp;quot;direct, active and digitised&rdquo; to double the direct reach in 12 months, he added.  &amp;quot;We expect to expand our direct reach by 2x in the next 12 months and target to double our total numeric reach in the next 36 months,&amp;quot; said D'Souza.  After merging consumer products business of Tata Chemicals with Tata Global Beverages, the company was renamed TCPL and now owns brands like TATA Salt, TATA Tea, Tetley, Eight O' clock and Himalayan Water.  &amp;quot;The company would leverage its access to the Tata Chemical R&amp;amp;amp;D centre for innovation agenda with a target of doubling the contribution from new products,&amp;quot; said D'Souza.  It would be upping its digital quotient, which includes leveraging digital technology from the front-end starting with the salesmen and stockists level.  TCPL is linking the entire supply chain, including warehousing, manufacturing and procurement, for &amp;quot;faster decision making, better cost-effectiveness and a more seamless way of working, as also scaling up e-commerce capability across platforms for all our businesses in India and international,&rdquo; he said.  Over expansion of sales network, D'Souza said it would work on its supply chain, which is scalable and can be leveraged for any new category or business, which TCPL wants to bolt on in the future.  &amp;quot;As part of the integration of the food and beverage businesses, we have initiated a sales and distribution re-design. This will result in a flatter, more agile structure leveraging digital technology, which will help us further expand our direct reach, leverage revenue and cost synergy and help us serve the end consumer better,&amp;quot; D'Souza added.  Besides, the company will also put in place a customised approach based on the characteristics of different channels such as wholesale, hot tea shops, premium grocery etc and have a dedicated team to serve them.  &amp;quot;There will be dedicated teams servicing alternative channels such as modern trade, e-commerce, institutions, food service and vending,&amp;quot; he said.  Moreover, TCPL would also relook at the rural distribution model to strengthen it significantly, which is growing faster than the urban after vastly recovering from coronavirus-related disruptions.  &ldquo;We believe that expanding numeric and weighted distribution across channels will help us strengthen our market shares in our core categories of tea and salt, as well as provide a significant growth platform for our new emerging portfolio of pulses, spices and coffee,&amp;quot; he said.  &amp;quot;We have a proven track record of creating category-defining brands in commodity spaces, like Tata Tea, Tata Salt and Tetley. We see similar opportunities in the staples and packaged food space too. Once we create the common platforms for execution, there are significant opportunities for us to move up the value chain into more value-added and premium products in the food and beverage space,&amp;quot; he said.  While talking on the traditional retail format versus e-commerce, he said TCPL needs a &ldquo;mix of different go to market channels&rdquo; to build a strong sales network and serve consumers effectively.  &amp;quot;It is important for us to strengthen and scale presence across all these channels. That's one of the reasons why we are putting in place a customised approach in our sales and distribution re-design with dedicated teams for different go to market channels. It is vital to stay close to the consumer so that we can quickly read consumer trends and changes in buying behaviour,&amp;quot; he added.  TCPL had a revenue of Rs 5,690.24 crore in FY2019-20.","Business, FMCF, Sunil D'Souza, Tata Consumer Products","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/tata-consumer-products-to-expand-direct-reach-to-consumers-says-md-sunil-d39souza_14205761.html
177,2020-08-24 12:02:36+05:30,Tata Steel Ltd.,TATASTEEL,"Coronavirus count | Tata Steel reports 472 positive cases, eight fatalities across units",Around 361 workers across Tata Steel plants have so far recovered from coronavirus.,"Tata Steel has reported 472 positive COVID-19 cases among its employees across its major manufacturing locations in India, Chairman N Chandrasekaran recently said.  Of these, 361 have recovered and eight have died, Chandrasekaran added.  As of March 2020, the company had 32,364 employees on its rolls and over 50,000 workers on contract.  Company executives said the incidence of the virus is low when compared with the large number of workers that come in daily across its three major facilities, in Jamshedpur, Angul and Kalinganagar.  COVID-19 cases have been reported in manufacturing companies across sectors, including in auto and heavy equipment. Among steel makers, JSW Steel had reported a little over 900 cases in early August. To control the spread, the company had asked over 11,000 workers to stay at home.  Tata Steel had introduced the POD concept in its manufacturing locations to counter&nbsp;COVID-19. &amp;quot;These measures are beyond the stipulated SOPs, which anyway are being strictly followed by the organisation,&amp;quot; the company had said recently.  How does the Pod work?  The staff is seated into small units called Pods, thus limiting their interaction with each other. Each pod has about 10 workers.  &amp;quot;All of the members have to maintain mandatory social distancing. Additionally, to reduce the risk of contamination across shifts, a 30-minutes air gap is maintained between two shifts,&amp;quot; the company said.  In the first 15 minutes, each work area and tools are sanitised. In the next 15 minutes, workers in the ensuing shift enter through a separate gate. The work areas and tools are again sanitised before being used.  Commenting on the advantage of the Pod system, Tata Steel said:  &amp;quot;As the procedure itself delineates, this process limits the spread of the virus across pods. If one person is infected, the entire pod is quarantined, but the rest of the pods can continue to work. It ensures business operations as the requisite workforce is present to do the job. Besides in case of any COVID19 positive case, the pod system enables contact tracing.&amp;quot;  A recent Telegraph report had said the company has moved to a 12-hour shift at its Jamshedpur, to reduce the movement of workers. In Angul and Kalinganagar, it had been operating on a 12-hour shift but moved back to the usual 8-hour schedule.","Business, Companies, Covid-19","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/coronavirus-count-|-tata-steel-reports-472-positive-cases-eight-fatalities-across-units_14208261.html

Considering an application by the Kerala government seeking the stay, the court adjourned the case for detailed hearing.  Directing the government to produce the documents before September 9, the bench said a detailed hearing in the matter will be held on September 15.  In its application, the state government said unless the stay is granted, it will be put to irreparable injury and hardship.  The state government filed the application in the court, after an all-party-meeting in the state demanded withdrawal of the Union Cabinet's decision last week to lease out the airport to Adani Enterprises.  Last year, the high court had dismissed the petition challenging the decision, terming it as not maintainable under Article 226 of the Constitution.

183,2020-08-28 16:50:15+05:30,Divi's Laboratories Ltd.,DIVISLAB,These five API companies may benefit as drugmakers seek to reduce dependence on Chinese raw material,"Both global and domestic drug companies are looking to diversify sourcing of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients and Key Starting Materials from China. Indian companies, particularly pure-play API producers, are poised to tap this emerging opportunity.","Supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19, coupled with the India-China border tensions, have brought to the fore the risk in depending on one geography, China, for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and key starting materials (KSMs).  Both global and domestic drug companies are looking to diversify sourcing of APIs and KSMs from China. An API is the active molecule that gives a drug its efficacy, while KSMs are key raw materials used in the manufacture of APIs.  Some Indian drug makers, especially those involved in the manufacture of APIs, did see some benefits in Q1FY21, but analysts say these are still early days, as many drug companies, in anticipation of shortages, have piled up raw material inventory.  They also don't rule out the possibility of Chinese suppliers trying to consolidate their dominance through enticing price cuts.  The Indian government, meanwhile, recently announced a production-linked incentive scheme for 53 critical bulk drugs to encourage domestic production. However, it may take some time for the scheme to be rolled out.  To be sure there are big companies such as Aurobindo Pharma, Dr Reddy's, Lupin and Sun Pharma with a huge API business that stand to potentially benefit from the shift, but this report will look at more pure-play API companies.  So, here is the list of five companies poised to benefit from API diversification:  Divis Laboratories  Divis Lab is a pure-play generic active pharmaceutical ingredients maker and does custom synthesis of active ingredients for innovator companies.  The company reported record sales and profits in Q1FY21. Its sales grew 49 percent YoY to Rs 1,730 crore for the June quarter, while net profit rose 80.61 percent to Rs 492.06 crore.  Divis Lab&rsquo;s Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) margin in Q1 stood at 40.5 percent. The company achieved this performance without any one-off gains or windfall opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The results aided Divis to become the second-most-valued pharmaceutical company, with market capitalisation of about Rs 87,000 crore.  Unlike many other Indian drug companies, Divis makes relatively fewer API products but is well integrated up to intermediate or KSM stage, and produces these products in high volumes. Divis Lab has global leadership in APIs such as anti-inflammatory Naproxen, anti-seizure Gabapentin, and cough-suppressant Dextromethorphan HBr, among others.  Analysts expect Divis to continue its momentum on account of efforts to increase the in-house manufacturing of intermediates and additional revenues from new capex.&nbsp;About 87 percent of Divis Lab&rsquo;s sales comes from exports.    &nbsp;Aarti Drugs  Aarti Drugs has become the alternative for many drugmakers looking to diversify their sourcing from China. For instance, a large paracetamol API maker that relies heavily on China for intermediate Para-aminophenol said it has tied up with Aarti Drugs.  Unlike Divis, Aarti Drugs gets much of its business from domestic pharma companies. And that is clearly helping the company, which has seen overall sales jump to Rs 544.67 crore &mdash; a year-on-year (Y-o-Y) increase of 34.34 percent &mdash; for the quarter ended June 2020.  Profit after tax rose 280.63 percent to Rs 85.45 crore on a Y-o-Y basis during the same period. The EBITDA margin stood at Rs 135.23 crore, up 146.89 percent&nbsp;Y-o-Y.  The company attributed the API segment&rsquo;s performance to both volume growth and good realisation in selling prices. Aarti Drugs saw good demand for APIs for antibiotic drugs such as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin. Traditionally, China is the major supplier here.  Analysts expect the company to benefit from new capacity and higher realisations, going forward.    Hikal&nbsp;  In May, Hikal announced successful development of the antiviral Favipiravir API and its intermediates, demonstrating its capabilities. Favipiravir is used to treat mild to moderate Covid-19 patients.  While Hikal isn't as big as Divis or Aarti Drugs, it can benefit from the uncertainty in Chinese supplies and efforts by Indian pharma to diversify. The company has three decades&rsquo; worth of experience and has API and intermediate facilities that are in compliance with regulators USFDA, EU and PMDA (Japan). Q1 was disappointing as revenues fell due to a steep fall in sales of its crop-protection chemicals.  Hikal&rsquo;s revenues dropped 12 percent YoY to Rs 352 crore, while net profit stood at 15 crore. API and intermediate sales saw a 5 percent YoY jump to Rs 213.7 crore, led by improved capacity ramp-up and better volume off-take by customers.  The company expects an improvement in capacity utilisation and higher volume off-take by customers based on new opportunities arising from supply-chain de-risking. Meanwhile the stock gained about 50 percent in 2020, and ended at Rs 173.60 on Friday, gaining 2.75 percent.    Neuland Labs  Neuland Labs, has been around for more than three decades, and is familiar with the demands and rigour of highly regulated markets. The company makes APIs and intermediates and supplies APIs to the US, Europe and Japanese markets.  The company manufactures Mirtazapine (anti-depressant), Sotalol (cardiac), Levetiracetam (anti-seizures), Levofloxacin (antibiotic), Salmeterol (anti-asthma), and Salbutamol (anti-asthma), among others. Neuland Labs says it is looking at backward integration of many of these products to gain market share.  The company is yet to capture the diversification opportunity in a big way, but the stock has gained on the tailwind of the potential Chinese opportunity. The company reported 13.7 percent YoY sales growth, at Rs 206.1 crore, in Q1. Net profit stood at Rs 15.1 crore.    Solara Active Pharma Sciences  Solara&nbsp;was formed in 2018 as a result of the de-merger of the API businesses of Strides and Sequent. The intention was to be a pure-play API company. With a portfolio of over 50 plus molecules,&nbsp;and two state-of-the-art research centres supported by six&nbsp; large-scale, multi-product facilities, it has the potential to&nbsp;seize the opportunity emerging from the diversification away from China.  The company&rsquo;s sales rose 5.53 percent YoY to Rs 348.42 crore in the quarter ended June 2020, while net profit rose 59.43 percent to Rs 42.28 crore.

185,2020-08-31 11:32:42+05:30,Eicher Motors Ltd.,EICHERMOT,Honda continues search for a bike to challenge Royal Enfield domination,The Japanese company does not have a single product in its global portfolio that can match Royal Enfield's niche range. Honda is looking to change that now as it seeks to revitalise its motorcycle business,"It has had stellar success in India with scooters, such as the ubiquitous Activa, but Honda has struggled to crack India&rsquo;s motorcycle market, despite operating here for a few decades now. Known for its racing heritage worldwide and for its middleweight and premium category bikes in the 600cc-1000cc range, Honda is still trying to get its footing right in India in the motorcycle category. For instance, it still does not have products that can rival the range sold by Royal Enfield.  But the Japanese two-wheeler giant is seeking to remedy that as it tries to revitalise its motorcycle business.  Royal Enfield&rsquo;s unchallenged run  Niche bike maker Royal Enfield has enjoyed an unchallenged run for several years now, becoming the cash cow for parent Eicher Motors,&nbsp;promoted by the Delhi-based Lal family. The product market addressed by Royal Enfield has not been efficiently targeted by any automaker till date at those specific price points.  The Eicher company claims to be the global leader in the middleweight category, having motorcycles in the 350c to 650cc engine range.  Enfield&rsquo;s bikes straddle the leisure, adventure, retro racer and cruiser segments, with prices starting at around Rs 1 lakh and going up to nearly Rs 3 lakh.  Nothing in the portfolio  Honda has been looking to enter this segment but is yet to launch any product. The Japanese company does not have a single product in its global portfolio that can match the design and styling characteristics of the Royal Enfield range.  As part of its global portfolio, Honda has cruisers Goldwing and Rebel but these do not carry any characteristics&nbsp;that can be likened to the Royal Enfield range.  In an interview with Moneycontrol, Atsushi Ogata, President, CEO and Managing Director, Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India, said: &ldquo;We do not have that kind of India-oriented fun bike. We have several big bikes selling in India in limited quantities. Of course we must study this kind of new category. Sooner than later you can see an answer on this.&rdquo;  Sources say that Honda is looking for a model that could be modelled around the Ducati Scrambler,&nbsp;a modern-day roadster.  In February, Pune-based Bajaj&nbsp;Auto launched the&nbsp;Vitpilen 250 and&nbsp;Svartpilen 250, both roadsters.  Shifting gears  Honda, India&rsquo;s second largest two-wheeler maker, has done very well in the scooter segment. Nearly seven in every ten wheelers sold by Honda in FY20 in the domestic market were scooters. But it has not had anywhere near the same success with bikes.  The company ended FY20 with a market share of 14 percent in the motorcycle segment, while its scooter segment market share settled at 57 percent, according to data provided by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.  The Munjal family controlled&nbsp;Hero MotoCorp&nbsp;remains the leader in the motorcycle segment. Riding high on entry-level, budget models such as the Splendor and HF Dawn, the Delhi-based company ended FY20 with a share of 52 percent in the motorcycle segment.  Honda launched the Hornet 200 last week in an attempt to grab a slice of the entry premium segment (150cc to 250cc) pie, which is currently dominated by&nbsp;Bajaj Auto. The Pulsar and Avenger maker commands a share of more than 40 percent in the entry premium segment.  Besides keeping an eye on Royal Enfield&rsquo;s niche segment, Honda is also looking to target the entry segment dominated by Hero. The company is working on products &nbsp;targeted at rural and semi-urban buyers.  More rivals for Royal Enfield  Last year, Bajaj Auto joined hands with Britain&rsquo;s Triumph Motorcycles to jointly develop motorcycles with engines in the 200cc to 800cc range. The first such bikes are expected to hit the market in 2022. With a rich legacy of over 100 years, Triumph has a product profile similar to Royal Enfield.  Mumbai-based UV-specialist Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra is also targeting the same segment with the rebirth of Czech bike brand Jawa. Two other brands &mdash; Yezdi and BSA &mdash; both on similar lines as the Royal Enfield, are also in the works.  More recently, TVS Motor Company, which recently bought the business assets of UK&rsquo;s Norton Motorcycles, also has the option of developing bikes to compete against Royal Enfield.","Auto, Business, Honda, Royal Enfield, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/honda-continues-search-forbike-to-challenge-royal-enfield-domination_14230481.html
186,2020-09-01 11:45:09+05:30,Tata Steel Ltd.,TATASTEEL,"Despite record drop in earnings and GDP in Q1, India Inc sees more than a silver lining for FY21",Most of the chief executives of companies expect recovery by the end of this FY,"Bad news from Q1 seems to be pouring in, much like the&nbsp;incessant rains in Mumbai, for India Inc.  The GDP contraction&nbsp; - by 23.9 percent - was much worse than the forecast of a 18.3 percent drop. It is the biggest contraction on record, and the steepest fall among the world's top economies.  BSE 100 companies saw their sales plummeting by an average 30 percent year-on-year, says a report by Credit Suisse. Operating profit, the report added, dropped 35 percent.&nbsp;The decline was most for energy sector (down by 57 percent) and auto (20 percent).  The results were accompanied by wide spread layoffs and salary cuts. For instance in aviation, more than half of the industry workforce has been sent on leave without pay.  But there is a silver lining - more than one actually - amid the dark clouds. The same Credit Suisse report says that some sectors such as IT and telecom saw an improvement in their margins. And scores of companies, from financial, FMCG and pharma sectors grew by over 10 percent.  A Bloomberg story adds that even though the revenues of 47 NSE Nifty 50 Index companies dropped 40 percent in the first quarter, nearly two-third of them met or exceeded estimates.  These positives tally with the commentary given by companies on the rest of the year, with most of them being cautiously optimistic. Here's a brief look at what these firms said, across sectors. Most of them see a definite recovery, and in some cases going back to pre-COVID-19 levels, by the first quarter of FY21.  Information Technology  Amid the pandemic, IT industry have fared better than expected as they were able to adopt to the new normal faster than expected. The IT firms were able to enable work from home for over 90 percent of their 50 lakh workforce in just a couple of weeks. This enabled them to support their clients during&nbsp;the pandemic, with an increased&nbsp;level of productivity. &nbsp;For the quarter ended June 2020, which was expected&nbsp;to bear the brunt of the pandemic, IT firms performed better than expected, in terms of growth and deal closures. This was in part aided by vendor consolidation and tech spending in the areas of cloud, work from home solutions and automation. Clients had no option but to invest in technology to ensure business continuity amid the pandemic.  Though the outlook is better than what the companies thought in&nbsp;April, IT firms are divided on their recovery. According to executives, recovery could begin as early as October or as late as early first quarter of FY22. Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO, TCS, during the Q1 results announcement said that the worst is over for the company and expects recovery starting Q3. C Vijayakumar, CEO, HCL Tech, in a recent interaction with Moneycontrol, said that he expects the recovery from Q4 or early Q1 FY22.  Automobile  Demand has sequentially&nbsp;improved over the last three&nbsp;months in passenger vehicle&nbsp;and two-wheeler&nbsp;segments. Almost all companies have witnessed either demand reaching pre-COVID-19 levels or were at about 90-95 percent of pre-COVID-19 levels. Companies like Hyundai have moved to a third and final shift at their plants.  The outlook&nbsp;for the rest of the year remains positive provided there are no production-related hiccups or further contraction in the economy. Automakers (PV and 2W) are expecting the festive period to be better than last year due to the low base effect.  Any intervention by the government in the form of an incentive-based scheme will be an added bonus. Two-wheeler companies especially hope that the government comes good on its statement on a GST cut. Nevertheless companies are still going ahead with scheduled launches. More than a dozen launches are planned in the remaining part of the year.    Shashank Srivastava, director (sales and marketing),&nbsp;Maruti Suzuki&nbsp;said in an analysts&nbsp;call, &amp;quot;It's so difficult to make a clear prediction of what the demand is going to be. However, having said that, the bounce-back has been encouraging, and we are looking forward with a lot of optimism.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Demand has continued to outstrip supply in July and August and this augurs well for the upcoming months. Supply will eventually&nbsp;catch up with demand. But we have to be mindful of the upcoming&nbsp;Shradh&nbsp;period too. But overall we are very positive for the festive months and for the remaining&nbsp;part of the&nbsp;year&amp;quot;, said a top executive of a two-wheeler manufacturer in north&nbsp;India.     FMCG  The onset of COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent lockdowns&nbsp;led to&nbsp;a disruption in manufacturing and companies saw their supply chain, and sales and distribution getting impacted.  Unprecedented disruptions in economic activity caused by nationwide lockdowns in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic weighed on the performance of most companies in the first quarter of FY21.  &ldquo;While constraints continue due to restrictions in several parts of the country and the near-term demand outlook remains uncertain, we remain well positioned to drive competitive, profitable, and responsible growth. The long-term structural opportunity of FMCG in India also remains intact,&amp;quot; said Sanjiv Mehta, Chairman &amp;amp;amp; Managing Director, HUL.  While announcing results for June quarter, Marico in its earnings statement had said that it is difficult to set an aspiration for FY21, until more clarity emerges in Q2. It would be the same for all its peers.  Retail  Retailers had to suffer huge losses due to the nationwide lockdown which lasted for over two months. According to the retailers&rsquo; association, non-essential retail sales plummeted 80 percent in May, from 50 percent in March.  Most retailers had to go on a spree of cost reduction including renegotiating rentals at stores, offices, and warehouses, with reducing overhead expenses.  &ldquo;Due to the various amended guidelines issued by local authorities including phasing/re-imposition of lockdowns to combat the spread of&nbsp;Covid-19, the store level activities have been impacted.The trajectory of recovery from this pause would depend on the playout of the Covid&nbsp;pandemic&nbsp;and its effect on consumer sentiment and confidence,&rdquo; V2 Retail Chairman and Managing Director Ram Chandra Agarwal.  He further added that the company anticipates the situation to stabilise and start turning positive from the third quarter of this fiscal year.  &amp;quot;We believe that there would be a serious uptick in consumer demand with the onset of the festive season starting from Durga Puja and Diwali.&rdquo;  Adds Spykar CEO Sanjay Vakharia: &ldquo;We expect the last quarter or the current FY to be very close to the previous year last quarter. So hopefully and subject to no further scares, we think consumption will limp back to it's normal by the mid of the next FY.&amp;quot;  Metals  The spectacular recovery in China, which was the first to be hit by COVID-19, has helped the global steel industry, including in India, to prune some of the losses from the ensuing lockdowns.  Indian steel companies, including Tata Steel and JSW Steel, made up for the loss in demand in domestic market, by exporting. Prices have also looked up, with rates increasing by up to Rs 3,500 a ton since July.  &amp;quot;Based on our checks, we expect domestic demand to be stable in August (vs. July) with some pick up in September. As long as demand stays stable, we believe high visibility on export orders until September provides confidence for the steel producers to keep prices high through 2Q despite weak domestic demand,&amp;quot; brokerage Morgan Stanley said in a recent report.  Little wonder, Tata Steel MD and CEO TV Narendran expects realisations to improve in the second quarter.&nbsp;  Aviation  The country's largest airline, IndiGo, may have reported one of its higgest quarterly losses in Q1&nbsp;, but the carrier has already managed to cut down on its cash burn, and expects to deploy 65 percent of its capacity by the third quarter.  CEO Ronojoy Dutta had also earlier spoken about the airline, and the aviation industry in general, recovering to pre-COVID-19 levels by the end of the financial year. Bookings have jumped by half, week-on-week, and online travel agencies seeing business getting back to up to 35 percent of pre-COVID-19 levels. This coincides with domestic airlines now frequently clocking 1,000 flights a day, and over a lakh passengers taking to the skies.  In fact, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Sing Puri expects a full recovery by Diwali.

When the pandemic gets over, certain categories will settle at an elevated level. When I say elevated level, it is in comparison to pandemic situation, but may not have the surge seen during the pandemic. So health and hygiene could be one such category, but the awareness and importance of simple things like hand washing and cleanliness would definitely go up,&amp;quot; said Puri at a virtual press interaction.  He said the need to clean fruits and vegetables has been accentuated by the COVID-19 pandemic&nbsp;and with the availability of&nbsp;scientific solutions like ITC Nimwash, the demand for such things would increase going forward.  &amp;quot;Maybe sanitisers won't be at a level as today, but it will certainly be at an elevated level going forward. We also have to prepare now for the next normal... That's were the adaptability, creativity and resilience of the enterprises would be tested,&amp;quot; Puri said.  He said as far as capacity is concerned,&nbsp;ITC has expanded its capacity way beyond its buffer capacity. &amp;quot;Our handwash, for example, is five to six times of what we were producing earlier. Capacity expansion has happened in house by commissioning some additional facilities... We have the infrastructure. What we need to do is we need to add machines over a period of time,&amp;quot; Puri said.  Manufacture of ITC&rsquo;s hygiene products like Savlon sanitisers was ramped up by 275 times to cater to the surge in demand. ITC ramped up production capacity and resumed distribution in record time, with focus on safety protocols. Over 180 factories manufacturing essential products in foods, personal care and hygiene as well as paperboards and packaging were progressively made operational.  More than 85 percent of ITC&rsquo;s associated warehouses were made operational within 10 days of the lockdown.  ITC's gross revenue and PBT (before exceptional items) for FY20 stood at around Rs 46,300 crore and Rs 19,300 crore, respectively. Non-cigarette segment revenue rose to Rs 31,000 crore during the year, accounting for nearly 60 percent of ITC&rsquo;s total segment revenue.

However, bulls could make a comeback only if Nifty manages to give a decisive move above 11,500 levels. Till then, stock-specific action would remain on the radar.  Here are three buy calls for the next 3-4 weeks:  Asian Paints | Buy | LTP: Rs 1,957.40 | Target price: Rs 2,110 | Stop loss: Rs 1,860 | Upside: 8 %  This stock has been consistently maintaining its uptrend and can be seen trading in a rising channel on broader charts.  However, for the last six trading sessions, prices have been consolidating in the range of Rs 1,900-2,000 which has formed a triangle pattern on daily charts.  The positive divergences on secondary oscillators suggest that the stock is likely to give upside breakout which could add further buying momentum to the prices towards new highs.  Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 1,950-1,960 for the upside target of Rs 2,110.  TV Today Network | Buy | LTP: Rs 232.50 | Target price: Rs 257 | Stop loss: Rs 215 | Upside: 11%  This stock has been consistently maintaining its bull run ever since it gave a breakout above Rs 200.  Additionally, prices are holding well above the 200-days exponential moving average on daily charts with consistent buying seen at support levels.  This week, we have observed a fresh breakout in the stock on broader charts with additionally higher volumes which suggest next up-move in the prices.  Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 231-234 for the upside target of Rs 257.  AstraZeneca Pharma | Buy | LTP: Rs 4,235 | Target price: Rs 5,175 | Stop loss: Rs 3,600 | Upside: 22%  This week, the stock has given a fresh breakout with big volumes on the charts and also made a fresh 52-week high of Rs 4,970 level.  However, due to profit-booking, it once again retraced back towards Rs 4,230.  On the broader charts, the stock is maintaining its uptrend and can be seen trading in a rising channel with the formation of a higher high and higher low pattern.  The price-volume breakout this week suggests that more upside is still due in the prices and any dip should be considered to enter fresh.  Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 4,200-4,250 for the upside target of Rs 5,175.

This is the first time in Royal Enfield&rsquo;s modern &nbsp;history &nbsp;that motorcycles will be assembled and produced outside the company&rsquo;s manufacturing facilities in Chennai.  This development comes as a surprise since Thailand was set to host the first assembly plant of Royal Enfield outside India in mid-2019. The company had also spoken about&nbsp;having a completely knocked down plant in Vietnam too.  Royal Enfield set up retail operations in Argentina in March 2018, with its first store in Vicente Lopez, Buenos Aires. Since then the company has expanded its retail network in the market and now has five exclusive stores in that country. Overall, Royal Enfield has 31 exclusive stores and 40 other retail touch points in all of Latin American countries.  The local assembly unit in Argentina will be based at Grupo Simpa&rsquo;s facility located in Campana, Buenos Aires. To begin with, the plant will locally assemble three motorcycle models - the Royal Enfield Himalayan, the Interceptor 650 and the Continental GT 650 - starting this month.  Vinod K Dasari, CEO, Royal Enfield, said, &ldquo;Over the last couple of years, we have grown our international presence significantly and now have retail presence across 60 countries.

On the higher side, multiple resistances at 11,650-11,700 levels would cap the upside.  The breadth continues to remain weak with swift correction in midcap and smallcap indices from their recent highs after a sharp up-move over the&nbsp;last few months.  The geopolitical concerns between India-China and global market volatility would continue to weigh on markets in the immediate term.  Bank Nifty is near its strong support levels of 21,800-22,000 and it gives a good opportunity to add longs in private banking stocks after the correction from its 200-day average.  Nifty Metals could see some corrective action as double top on monthly charts and price action over the past few days confirm a down move from the current levels.  Here are three buy calls for the next 2-3 weeks:  HDFC Life Insurance Company | Buy | LTP: Rs 602.65 | Target price: Rs 675 | Stop loss: Rs 565 | Upside: 12%  The stock has completed its corrective price action from the recent high of Rs 647.  Daily RSI has also reversed upwards from the lower range and is trading above the long-term average indicating a bullish setup.  Multiple support levels in the range of Rs 555-565, being the 100 and 200-day averages, offer a good risk-reward&nbsp;ratio from the current levels.  Hindustan Unilever (HUL) | Buy | LTP: Rs 2,134.70 | Target price: Rs 2,400 | Stop loss: Rs 1,965 | Upside: 12%  The stock has closed near its long-term support zone and witnessed positive pullbacks from the current levels on various counts.  Weekly RSI has crossed from its average line, indicating a strong breakout and the sector is also in positive momentum which could get the stock to test the intermediate-high as the potential target over the next few months.  ICICI Bank | Buy | LTP: Rs 371.50 | Target price: Rs 415 | Stop loss: Rs 345 | Upside: 12%  ICICI Bank has witnessed good correction from its 200-day average and is now trading near multi-week average supports.  The recent correction is a good entry point to accumulate the stock as the risk-reward is in favour of a long up-move from the current levels.  Daily RSI is trading above 40 levels indicating a bullish setup for the stock.

The country imported 19.14MT of coal in August last year, according to provisional compilation by mjunction, based on monitoring of vessels&rsquo; positions and data received from shipping companies.  mjunction, a joint venture between Tata Steel and SAIL, is a B2B e-commerce company that also publishes research reports on coal and steel verticals.  Also, the first five months of the current fiscal saw 32.51 percent decline in coal import at 73.08MT, over 108.29MT during the year-ago period, it said.  &amp;quot;Although there has been a modest recovery in coal-consuming sectors such as power and cement, coal stock continues to be ample and hence import demand subdued. If we go by the current trend, coal imports may see a significant decline this year,&amp;quot; it said.  Of the total imports in August, non-coking coal's shipment was at 8.87MT and coking coal at 2.18MT.  Coal India (CIL), which accounts for over 80 percent of domestic coal output, has been mandated by the government to replace at least 100 million tonnes of imports with domestically-produced coal in the ongoing fiscal. To boost coal demand, the government has announced a slew of measures like increased supply for linkage consumers.  The Centre had also announced several relief measures for CIL consumers, including the power sector.

200,2020-09-14 07:00:31+05:30,Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd.,ADANIPORTS,Hot Stocks | Here's why Adani Ports and Wipro are a buy for short-term,"As far as levels are concerned, 11,550-11,650 are likely to act as immediate hurdles; whereas on the lower side, 11,350-11,200 would work as a key support zone.","  In the week gone by, no further damage was done after a previous week&rsquo;s hiccups.  However, the overall intra-week range was extremely small and barring one or two days, there was no major activity in indices.  One should still continue with a slightly cautious stance because the uncertainty is still looming over and till the time we do not get clarity with respect to all these developments, better to stay light with a stock-specific approach.  As far as levels are concerned, 11,550-11,650 are likely to act as immediate hurdles; whereas on the lower side, 11,350-11,200 would work as a key support zone.  Also Listen to: The Market Podcast |&nbsp;'Frog in the well' syndrome has limited investors to India, go global says Shankar Sharma  Last week, most gains were contributed by the stellar move in Reliance Industries towards the fag end and IT stocks also chipped in.  At this juncture, the banking index is clearly underperforming and is placed around a crucial junction.  We are observing a cluster of support around 22,200-22,000 and till the time it is defended, we can expect some recovery in the market.  However, if it fails to hold this, Nifty can easily slide below the key support of 11,200. So, one should keep a close eye on all these possibilities and should position accordingly.  Here are two buy and one sell call for the next 1-2 weeks:  Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone | Buy | LTP: Rs 340.55 | Target price: Rs 360 | Stop loss: Rs 332 | Upside: 6%  This stock has corrected gradually over the past couple of weeks.  However, it has now reached a cluster of support such as a converging point of two key moving averages, &rsquo;89 EMA&rsquo; as well as &lsquo;200-SMA&rsquo; on the daily chart.  Importantly, Friday&rsquo;s candle resembles a 'Bullish Hammer' pattern and hence, we expect the stock to give a recovery in the next few days.  Wipro | Buy | LTP: Rs 292.55 | Target price: Rs 310 | Stop loss: Rs 282 | Upside: 6%  The entire IT space provided a good helping hand to defend Nifty last week along with the major contributor Reliance.  However, unlike other peers, the activity in Wipro remained muted till Thursday. On Friday, this stock seems to have come out of its consolidation and finally joined hands with larger peers.  The daily chart depicts a &lsquo;Bullish Flag&rsquo; pattern along with more than average daily volumes.  The way charts are shaped up, we expect the stock to do well in the next few days.  PVR | Sell | LTP: Rs 1,257 | Target price: Rs 1,220 | Stop loss: Rs 1,290  After the March mayhem, the stock prices initially consolidated and then gave some decent recovery in the last couple of months.  However, the up-move seems to have paused for a while and prices are in a declining mode again.  On the daily chart, prices have slipped below key short-term averages and in fact, the combination of 5 and 20-day EMA has confirmed a bearish crossover.

Revenues de-grew 15.6% YoY to Rs 2172 crore due to a 41.2% YoY decline in hospital revenues to Rs 795 crore amid the pandemic. On the other hand, Pharmacy segment posted strong revenue growth of 21.0% YoY to Rs 1279 crore. EBITDA margins dropped to 1.6% vs. 13.8% in Q1FY20 due to negative operating leverage.

At an aggregate level, in our view, PWGR should be able to generate ~14% equity IRR (assuming a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20 for its 11 under-construction projects). Equity IRR for its eight commissioned TBCB projects varies in the range of 2-27%. TBCB currently remains small in the overall context (3% FY20 PAT; 5% gross block). However, with increased awarding at the interstate/intrastate level on a TBCB basis, its pie would eventually grow. Over the past one year, PWGR has won ~7 projects on a TBCB basis. We expect profits from TBCB projects to rise to INR7.8b in FY23 from INR3.7b as new projects get commissioned. Outlook However, subsequent lower capital expenditure (along with the removal of DDT) also implies potential for higher dividends. We expect DPS to rise to INR14.3/sh in FY22, from INR10/sh in FY20, implying FY22 dividend yield of ~8%.

Mehta also said interest rates need to be cut after signs of urban distress due to the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a report by The Economic Times.  &amp;quot;There is a curve of cost of doing and the cost of not doing,&amp;quot; Mehta said, as quoted by the paper.  Mehta made the comments during a web interaction with Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &amp;amp;amp; Industry (FICCI) President Sangita Reddy.  &amp;quot;When the cost of not doing exceeds the cost of doing, then it would be a very unfortunate situation for the country. We should not let that happen - we should definitely take the risk of being aggressive with spending. Because, if we don't do it now, then it might become a bit too late,&amp;quot; Mehta said.  The government needs to raise spending even with the risk of inflation, he added.  &amp;quot;There is a risk of inflation, but the bigger risk is the economy going into a tailspin. So there should be an aggressiveness with which we reduce the interest rates, clearly with the risk that there could be more inflation coming,&amp;quot; Mehta said. The Indian economy has been hammered by the COVID-19 outbreak, with the gross domestic product (GDP) contracting nearly 24 percent in the April-June quarter.  Nearly 6 million white collar professional jobs were lost between May and August, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).

210,2020-09-22 12:30:13+05:30,Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.,SUNPHARMA,Exclusive: BDR Pharma ready with Favipiravir 800 mg pills; will ease Covid-19 patients&rsquo; pill burden,The huge number of tablets to be consumed daily has been cited as one of the reasons for the drop in patient compliance with the treatment.,"  BDR Pharmaceuticals will soon be launching an 800 mg version of the Favipiravir tablet, which is expected to significantly reduce the pill burden on Covid-19 patients. The 800 mg tablet will reduce the number of tablets to 30 for a 14-day course.  In India, Favipiravir is used in the treatment of mild to moderate cases of Covid-19.  Currently, Favipiravir tablets are available in 200 mg and 400 mg versions. A patient has to pop a total of 122 tablets in a 14-day course for 200 mg, while the 400 mg halves the number of pills to 61.  &ldquo;We have been inspected by the DCGI and our samples have been approved in the lab. We are expecting the clearance anytime this week,&rdquo; said Dharmesh Shah, Chairman of BDR Pharmaceuticals.  Also Read:&nbsp;Roche&rsquo;s Tocilizumab cuts likelihood of death in COVID-19 hospitalised patients with associated pneumonia by 44%  &ldquo;The patient has to take a loading dose of 3,600 mg on day one, followed by 1,600 mg on the remaining days, so 800 mg will be a convenient dose,&rdquo; Shah added.  The high pill burden is cited as one of the reasons for drop in patient compliance with the treatment.  BDR has launched 200 mg and 400 mg versions on its own, under brand name BDFAVI, and also supplies Sun Pharma, Brinton Pharmaceuticals and Blue Cross Laboratories.  Price drop  Favipiravir, an antiviral drug that has been used in the treatment of influenza in Japan since 2014, was approved by the Drug Controller General of India for treatment of mild to moderate Covid cases.  Over a dozen companies have been marketing favipiravir, with prices dropping as low as Rs 33 per tablet of 200 mg dosage, a fall of close to 70 percent in less than two months since Glenmark launched its Favipiravir tablets.  India has reported close to 5.56 million Covid cases and 88,935 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins Covid-19 tracker. There are close to a million active cases, of which at least 20 percent would need oxygen. Cases have been rising by about 90,000 on a daily basis.  Demand for Remdesivir outstrips supply  Meanwhile, demand for Remdesivir, a broad-spectrum injectible antiviral medication developed by Gilead Sciences, continues to surge. The drug is yet to reach smaller towns, where the black market is thriving as cases rise. Shortages have been reported even in large cities, including Mumbai.  Shah said demand for Remdesivir is still outstripping supply, as Covid-19 cases continue to rise in India and globally.  He says the capacity of Remdesivir is around 5 lakh vials, with Cipla-BDR and Hetero the dominant producers.  BDR, which exclusively supplies the Remdesivir active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) to Cipla, scaled up to 250,000 vials capacity in September from just 70,000-80,000 in July.  Shah said BDR&rsquo;s partnership with Cipla is progressing well, even as Cipla works to develop and produce Remdesivir in-house at its Goa facility to augment capacity.  &ldquo;We are increasing quantity month on month. Right now the requirement is much more than supply. There is a need for more supplies. In any case if Cipla is doing it at Goa, it will have to cater to the rest of world &mdash; 127 countries. We need additional capacity,&rdquo; Shah said.  Not a cheap drug  Remdesivir is prescribed for hospitalised patients who are on oxygen. The drug has to be taken for five days, with 200 mg IV (intravenous) on day 1 followed by 100 mg IV daily for four days.  The drug was approved as an experimental therapy for restricted emergency use on patients.  A vial of the medication from Cipla costs Rs 4,000 while Hetero's product is priced highest, at Rs 5,400 per vial.  Zydus Cadila&nbsp;has launched the cheapest Remdesivir injection, at Rs 2,800 per 100 mg vial. The other companies to have launched Remdesivir include Mylan, Jubilant Life Sciences,&nbsp;and Dr Reddy&rsquo;s.  Shah says that while Zydus had the advantage of coming in late, other companies are offering the drug to the government at a price similar to that quoted by Zydus.","Business, Companies, coronavirus, Health","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/viswanath-pilla-6848/', 'name': 'Viswanath Pilla'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/exclusive-bdr-pharma-readyfavipiravir-800-mg-pills-will-ease-covid-19-patientsÃ¢ÂÂ-pill-burden_14298901.html

The company was dealt a severe blow by COVID-19 as the pandemic triggered strict lockdowns completely battered the retail sector.  In the calendar year so far, shares of this one of the largest, most efficient and profitable specialty retailer in India are 7 percent down.  The company reported a net standalone loss of Rs 270 crore for the quarter ended June 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic hit business. The loss was higher than a CNBC-TV18 poll estimate of Rs 175 crore.  Standalone revenue during the quarter declined 62.3 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,862 crore compared to the corresponding period last fiscal.  Light at the end of the tunnel  Titan can get benefits from the strong market share in the jewellery and wrist watches segment mainly driven by a wide range of product portfolio catering mainly to the premium and value-added designer jewellery segment.  Brokerages highlight Titan has major revenue and EBIDTA comes from the jewellery segment which is highly sensitive to the overall macro-economic scenario. The company also benefits out of a large share of franchisee sales which helps more in the current times of underutilization.  Reports indicate Tanishq revenues have recovered to 90 percent of pre-COVID levels &ndash; significantly ahead of consensus expectations.  Brokerage firm ICICI Securities has upgraded the stock to 'add' from 'hold', with a DCF-based revised target price of Rs 1,250 from Rs 1,100 earlier.  The brokerage has increased FY22 earnings estimates by nearly 2 percent and modelled revenue, EBITDA and PAT CAGR of 14, 13 and 16 percent, respectively over FY20-22E.  &amp;quot;As Tanishq revenues have recovered significantly ahead of consensus expectations, likely drivers of this trend are (1) boost to volumes due to (somewhat) stable gold prices, (2) consumers have (likely) started accepting higher gold prices and expect further inflation and (3) market share gains (liquidity challenges for smaller competitors),&amp;quot; ICICI Securities said.  &amp;quot;Upside trigger is gold price correction or volatility leading to a surge in volumes. That said, the introduction of fixed making charges, even though a small proportion currently, is something that we will watch carefully,&amp;quot; the brokerage added.  Brokerage firm HDFC Securities has a buy call on the stock with a base case fair value of Rs 1,192 and a bull case fair value of Rs 1,266 for six months.  HDFC Securities is of the view that the Indian retail industry is likely to go through a strong consolidation phase which is likely to benefit companies of the likes of Titan mainly due to its robust balance sheet and phenomenal track record of consistent market share gains.  The brokerage added that the management continued focus on new launches and consistent expansion of the product portfolio by entering into newer categories is further likely to fuel future growth.  The brokerage expects that COVID-19 led lockdown and slowdown in the economy will lead to subdued growth and sluggish operational performance in FY21.  &amp;quot;Titan is a structural growth story and is a strong play on the consumption theme and rides on the long-term opportunity on rising income, increased discretionary spending, gains from penetration and premiumisation trends,&amp;quot; HDFC Securities said.

Channel checks point to strong growth momentum - ahead of peers - driven by increased at-home consumption and share gains.

We have also built in some moderation (9% growth in FY22E) but believe that benefits of share gains from unorganized players and shift to packaged food will stay longer. 15-year trends indicate BRIT has delivered double-digit growth after every year of high growth. Gross margin outlook has improved further with recent 10% correction in wheat prices. Q1 margins were significantly higher, led by multiple drivers. While ad spends may increase, lower input prices, cost efficiencies and cut in discretionary spends offer plenty of upsides.

In August, the Milwaukee-based cruiser bike maker had indicated exiting some of the loss-making international markets to reroute focus on the US market.  Poor sales record and a dented demand outlook impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic forced the bike maker to exit the Indian market.  Harley-Davidson India sold less than 2,500 units in the last financial year, making it one of its worst-performing international markets.  About 70 of Harley-Davidson&rsquo;s employees will be laid off as a result. The company has an assembly unit in Bawal, Haryana.  In&nbsp;FY19, the sales of Harley bikes in India fell 22 percent to 2,676 units&nbsp;as against 3,413 units sold in FY18. About 65 percent of Harley&rsquo;s India volumes come from smaller capacity bikes of 750cc that it assembles at Haryana.  Harley-Davidson will join the growing list of automotive brands, such as&nbsp;General Motors, Fiat, Ssangyong, Scania, MAN, UM Motorcycles, which have exited India over the last 3-4 years.  A couple of years ago Harley tied up with a Chinese company Qianjiang to build a new motorcycle having a sub 350cc engine. The launch was supposed to take place this year, but there has been no news of the project in recent months.  The baby Harley was to address the lower mid-capacity buyers presently catered to by Royal Enfield.  In India, Harley-Davidson faces competition from the Eicher Motors-controlled Royal Enfield in the cruiser motorcycling category. While Harley-Davidson&rsquo;s range starts around Rs 6 lakh, Royal Enfield has motorcycles starting at Rs 1 lakh.  In February this year, Harley completed 25,000 sales in India - it took Harley 10 years to achieve that feat. The US clocks more sales than that in a quarter. Nearly 75 percent of Harley&rsquo;s worldwide sales come from the US and Europe, with the US commanding 56 percent of the share.  Through the &lsquo;Rewire&rsquo; programme that was kick-started a couple of months ago, Harley intends to have a more streamlined product portfolio and a leaner cost structure.  About 8 years ago, Harley-Davidson India outlined medium-term plans for the country which included clocking sales of 10,000 units a month by 2016. This came after the company witnessed encouraging demand through the setting up of an assembly plant in Haryana.  Harley competes against Triumph, Indian, Benelli, Kawasaki, Ducati, Aprilia and premium range of Yamaha, Kawasaki, Suzuki and Honda. Most of these brands do not share sales data with the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturer.  While Harley could not join hands with any of the Indian companies for a collaboration, the UK's Triumph Motorcycles announced a partnership with Pune&rsquo;s Bajaj Auto for developing a range of bikes having engines in the range of 200-750cc. The first of these bikes hits the market in 2022.  German giant BMW tied up with TVS Motor Company and even has a couple of motorcycles in the market which are manufactured in Chennai.","Auto, Business, Harley-Davidson, India, Technology, video","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/harley-davidson-shuts-down-india-operations-70-employees-faceaxe_14306361.html

This has impacted not just India but Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and other Asian countries also which have a thriving medical tourism sector&rdquo;, Apollo Hospitals Group Joint MD Sangita Reddy told PTI.  While there is easing out of the lockdown, it will take government level discussions to help bring patients in for treatment, she added.  &amp;quot;For example, Malaysia has seen some patients coming in for open-heart surgery from Brunei as a direct result of government level discussions. Similarly, in India, there is a need for government support to ensure that medical value tourism in India gets back on its feet,&rdquo; Reddy said.  Medical value travel tourism is still nascent in India and holds great potential.  NITI&nbsp;Aayog has identified medical value travel as one of the major growth drivers and a major source of forex earning, she added.  &amp;quot;As the world unlocks, we will see a gradual increase in patients, all taking due precautions, turn to India for their treatments. In a world where people have become increasingly cost conscious, India offers a significant advantage with high quality, high value care,&amp;quot; Reddy said.  Highlighting the role of the medical tourism segment in the company&rsquo;s portfolio, she said the last fiscal saw patients from over 50 countries trusting Apollo Hospitals with their healthcare needs.  &amp;quot;Our international patients division extended care to over 2 lakh patients in the last fiscal with a small but significant contribution of around 13 percent to our revenue from the healthcare segment,&rdquo; she added.  The company&rsquo;s revenue from medical tourism was growing steadily, but it has been impacted by restrictions on international air travel, Reddy said.  &amp;quot;We have seen our revenue from medical value travel growing at 17-18 percent year-on-year. However, this has been impacted by the air travel restrictions due to COVID.

Highlighting the trust international patients repose in Apollo Hospitals, she said: &amp;quot;International patients trust Apollo Hospitals for its advanced medical technology and skilled medical professionals. It is cost-effective for the patients as they get care of international standards at a fraction of the cost.&rdquo;  The main procedures for which patients come to Apollo include treatments for cancer, organ transplant, cardiac procedures, orthopaedics and neurosurgery.  While these are the main procedures, the patients come for all kinds of treatment like eye procedures, dental treatment, etc.  India is one of the most attractive destinations because of the high quality of care, Reddy said.

The country's potential to produce talent and software at large scale, coupled with geo-political scenario with China, presents a wonderful opportunity for India to indigenise technologies, Tech Mahindra network services CEO Manish Vyas told PTI.  In June, the company signed an agreement with ITI Limited for development of 4G and 5G technologies.  &amp;quot;We are in the stages of exchanging design, starting to plan and also doing a couple of test runs and trials based on the technology that they are looking to manufacture. Pretty advanced stages, it''s not something that will take years but months for them to start doing it and of course, it depends on how quickly they start winning business in this area,&amp;quot; Vyas said.  He said the partnership to exchange technology with ITI is in line with the government''s strong desire to get back the state-run company in manufacturing high-end technology products.  &amp;quot;We are going to be helping them with the reference design with the transfer of technology that will enable them to put together the process and the plans to start manufacturing the radio units which are very specific to both 4G and 5G going forward, to an architecture which is an open source, open radio access network-based architecture,&amp;quot; he said.  Under government rule, ITI gets some quota to provide equipment that can be installed in the network of public sector telecom companies BSNL and MTNL.  ITI has also won a Rs 7,796 crore contract to build communication networks for the Defence sector.  Vyas said ITI getting back into high-end manufacturing will be a wonderful opportunity for them and other manufacturers of India.  &amp;quot;This (India) market will require hundreds of thousands of radio units in the next few years globally. Millions I would say, and it will require a facility that people can trust, a country that people can trust, in terms of security from a data standpoint, I think it''s a wonderful job. Our partnership is built around enabling them to be able to get back to manufacturing and to seize this moment and opportunity,&amp;quot; he said.  Tech Mahindra is already working with Japan''s Rakuten Mobile on development of 5G technology.  Vyas said that the company will not directly get into telecom equipment manufacturing but support companies worldwide in developing their network gears.  &amp;quot;Tech Mahindra today works for every single major telecom firm outside China. Every single major service provider anywhere in the world, in every country that we care for, in the sense we operate in, in Africa and Latin America, in Europe and Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, Japan, America, Canada,&amp;quot; he said.  Vyas said that all the top three or four service providers in each of the countries where Tech Mahindra operates are its customers.  &amp;quot;It gives us an opportunity to participate with 150 operators globally.

The survey by SBI Life Insurance in partnership with Nielsen showed that 80 percent (8 out of 10) Indians believe that buying life insurance is key.  Similarly, 75 percent (7 out of 10) who don&rsquo;t have a critical illness health plan are planning to buy it within the next three months. This is to help address the rising medical costs and financial burden on the family due to rise in ailments like COVID-19, amongst others.  The survey was conducted among 2,435 people across the country.  Ravi Krishnamurthy, president-zone 1, SBI Life Insurance said health has been a key focus among Indian customers ever since the pandemic broke out.  &ldquo;There is a clear spike in searches for term plans and health products. The industry will benefit due to the rising awareness for the products,&rdquo; he added.  While he did not specify the number of coronavirus death claims settled so far by the company, Krishnamurthy said there is a priority given to settle COVID-19 claims.  The survey showed that while life insurance followed by health insurance are the top-most financial products bought with an intention to safeguard the family&rsquo;s future.  The allied financial costs related to COVID-19 treatment are also a key factor in purchase of health insurance. SBI Life&rsquo;s survey showed that 53 percent of Indians are not financially prepared to bear the cost of COVID-19 treatment.  IRDAI chairman Subhash Khuntia had earlier said so far a total of 2,38,160 COVID-19 health claims have been filed. Of these, 1,48,298 claims worth Rs 1,430 crore have been settled.  Moneycontrol had reported earlier that despite several thousand COVID-19 deaths, the insurance claims remain low.  A total of 96,318 people have died due to COVID-19 in India. There are 61,45,292 reported positive COVID-19 cases in the country.  Going forward, Krishnamuthy said the proposed standard term plan would help in making the product simpler and helping customers to purchase a plain vanilla protection plan.  Term plan or pure protection plan pays an insurance claim if the policyholder dies during the policy term.  General insurers have also launched&nbsp;specific health insurance products - Corona Kavach and Corona Rakshak- to cater to the need arising out of the coronavirus pandemic.","Business, coronavirus, India, SBI Life Insurance, stocks","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/m-saraswathy-728/', 'name': 'M Saraswathy'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/covid-19-impact-|-lifehealth-insurance-becomingdominant-need-sbi-life-survey_14318761.html

From April to September, even as domestic production of iron ore slumped, exports have jumped, leading to shortage of raw material for local steel producers and putting livelihoods in jeopardy.","Multiple industry associations have written to PK Sinha, principal advisor to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to ban exports of iron ore to&nbsp;make up of the shortage of the important raw material for steel-making in the domestic market.  The shortage has especially pinched&nbsp;the secondary steel makers, who don't have captive mines sourcing to their units, unlike the primary producers.  Associations, including Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and All India Induction Furnaces Association (AIIFA), wrote to Sinha on September 25, highlighting the spurt in exports during the lockdown and after, from April to September.  They pointed out that&nbsp;domestic production of iron ore has slumped, not just leading to shortage of the raw material but also bumping up its price.  &amp;quot;Steel makers are forced to increase prices, passing on the hike in cost of production to customers, who are at a loss. Only China and the commercial miners are gaining,&amp;quot; said a senior executive from the steel industry.  The numbers  About half of India's annual steel output is produced by secondary steel producers. Unlike primary producers such as Tata Steel and JSW Steel, these units are much smaller in scale. They&nbsp;cannot&nbsp;compete against their larger peers when iron ore mines are auctioned.  Many of these secondary producers have sponge iron plants that need a constant supply of iron ore. Sponge iron is an intermediate product used in steel making.  &amp;quot;India had already started stepping up its iron ore exports since last year to bridge the global supply gap, as flows from the world&rsquo;s two biggest producers &ndash; Brazil and Australia &ndash; were on a decline,&amp;quot;&nbsp;AIIFA said in its letter to the Prime Minister's Office. Over 80 percent of the exports were to China.  The industry faced a unique paradox during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown.&nbsp;Even as domestic iron ore production slumped by half to 47 million in tons in the April to September period, exports jumped by 63 percent to 22 million tons over the same time.  The industry associations said that many secondary units have been forced to shut shop, especially in Odisha and Chhattisgarh, which together have nearly 140 sponge iron units. Others are operating at half their capacity.  The&nbsp;executive&nbsp;quoted above&nbsp;added that the NMDC, the state-owned miner,&nbsp;&amp;quot;has an agreement to supply iron ore to Japan and Korea, with whom India has a free trade agreement, and is pushing around 3 million tons of iron ore per annum at throw away prices.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;It is utmost important to ban the exports of iron ore for the survival of the secondary steel producers and help prevent huge job losses in the steel sector,&amp;quot; the associations said.","Business, Companies","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/ban-iron-ore-exports-industry-associationsletter-to-pmo_14319601.html

The bank expects a credit growth rate in mid-single digit in FY21 and in mid-teens in FY22. NIMs may come under pressure in the near term due to low LDR and high impairment, but the planned high share of retail (65% vs. 52%) should be positive in the long run. IIB has raised LLP guidance from 225-250bps (ex-RSA) in FY21 to 350-400bps (incl. RSA) in FY21E, given its stance to accelerate specific PCR to ~70% (from 67% now) and 30% provision on RSA vs. regulatory requirement of 10%. Factoring in the provision up-fronting, we cut FY21E earnings by 22% but raise FY23 estimates by 5%. IIB has recovered from the deposit scare and the immediate risk of Vodafone default has eased.

Time Frame: Six months. Technical View The IT sector remain in secular up trend since bottoming out in March 2020. As the major IT companies as trading at their all-time highs and are forming higher peak and higher trough in all time frame. The share price of Tech Mahindra is currently placed at the previous multiple high since February 2019 around Rs 840-850 levels. We expect the stock to resolve above the same and extend the current up move. Our expectation of resolving above the major hurdle of Rs 840-850 is based on the following key observations: a) the entire consolidation of the last eight months has taken the shape of a bullish rounding formation signalling a reversal of the corrective trend and resumption of fresh up move. b) it has witnessed a faster retracement as it has completely retraced its previous four quarter decline (Rs 846-471) in just two quarters. c) the last quarter up move is backed by strong volume of highest since CY 2009 highlighting larger participation. Hence, we expect the stock to continue with its positive momentum and head towards Rs 950 levels in the coming months as it is the 123.6% external retracement of the entire CY&rsquo;20 decline (Rs 846-471). Fundamental View Tech Mahindra is an IT service company catering to various segments like communication (~40%), manufacturing (~17%), technology, media &amp;amp;amp; entertainment (~9%), Banking Financial, Services &amp;amp;amp; insurance (~16%), retail transport &amp;amp;amp; logistics (~7.3%) and others (11.2%). Geographically, the company generates ~49% revenues from Americas, 26% from Europe and 25% from rest of the world. The company is aiming to improve revenues and reaching industry leading growth by focusing on cross sell opportunities. The company is also increasing its. resource allocation to high growth geographies and reducing its focus on emerging &amp;amp;amp; low growth geographies. Apart from improving revenues, the company is also rationalising cost to improve margins. The company aims to improve margins by improving margins of portfolio companies, lowering of discretionary spend, lower facility cost, lower travel cost, increased automation in some of the service lines, higher offshoring and benefits of large deal won in previous quarter. We believe ramp up of large deal won in previous quarters and improvement in deal wins in coming quarters will drive revenues. Further, in the long term, we believe its leadership in communication vertical will make it a key beneficiary of vendor consolidation in the segment. It would also benefit from 5G opportunities. Enterprise segment will also benefit from improved digital traction, success in large deals. Hence, we remain positive on the stock.

We believe gKuvan&rsquo;s contribution to DRRD earnings will be sustainable over FY21-FY24E as there are no generic filers and pending ANDA&rsquo;s. While Endo launched both Tab and PFOS (powder) form, DRRD launched only the tab form and we assume the PFOS form to be also launched soon. The US market of Kuvan is equally divided between Tab and PFOS forms. Following BioMarin&rsquo;s co-pay assistance program, DRRD also offered co-pay assistance while Endo is yet to offer a similar strategy after its launch on 1st Oct CY20. However, considering the early days of launch there is still limited information on their co-pay strategy. We anticipate Kuvan to remain a three-player market and DRRD may likely capture gradually 20-40% market share with 50-80% price erosion from the branded market and may reach its peak sales up to US$45m. This leads to an EPS contribution of Rs2.0/9.90/7.30 for FY21/22/23E. With limited information on the co-pay program and strategy to gain Rx traction for gKuvan, we wait for further clarity on their strategy (profitability in co-pay program) for US and EU (market size US$80-100m) before discounting in our earnings estimates.

230,2020-10-07 13:07:31+05:30,Titan Company Ltd.,TITAN,Normalcy returning to business in Q2; jewellery division leads recovery: Titan,The company had reported an unprecedented net loss of Rs 297 crore in the April-June quarter due to the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Tata group firm Titan on Wednesday said its business has been returning to normalcy led by recovery of sales in its jewellery division in the second quarter of the current fiscal. The company had reported an unprecedented net loss of Rs 297 crore in the April-June quarter due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 'The company's return to normalcy on the business front has been progressing well with the almost complete lifting of restrictions in phased manner over last few months across the country,&rdquo; Titan said in its quarterly update. It stated that there has been greater acceptance of the new normal amongst consumers and they have been getting back to many of their routine activities leading to a positive on the walk-ins to the stores and time spent in stores. The company is now gearing up to gain well from the upcoming festival season which is expected to further uplift the mood of the consumers. Titan said business through the e-commerce channel has grown significantly across all divisions. Opening of malls have also helped, but the footfalls are still relatively low in these stores. As the sales are reviving at a healthy pace, the network expansion has also resumed, the company added. Titan said the jewellery division did very well in the second quarter, with a recovery rate of around 98 per cent (excluding sale of raw gold), compared to the revenue of the same quarter in last year. 'The recovery rate in metros that have got impacted the most by the pandemic has been improving gradually. Non-metros seem to have recovered substantially and many cities have actually recorded growth compared to last year,&rdquo; it said. Sales in September have been decent, despite the inauspicious period of 'Shradh', it said, adding that the festival season will commence about 15 days later in the current year. The company said it continued to sell excess gold in its inventory and the quarter had a sale of Rs 390 crore of raw gold. This has helped improve the cash flow of the division significantly. Titan said it added 14 Tanishq stores on a net basis in the current fiscal. Titan said its watches and wearables division had a recovery rate of around 55 per cent in Q2, compared to the revenue of same quarter in last year, with a recovery of 70 per cent in September. 'E-commerce is leading the recovery with absolute growth but the trade channel continues to pose challenges primarily due to destocking. &ldquo;The recovery rate for the business has been steadily increasing month-on-month driven primarily by increasing walk-ins to the stores. The conversion rate and ticket size (led by high-value customers) has been tracking higher compared to pre-COVID-19 levels,' the company said. Eye wear division reported a recovery of 58 per cent in Q2, compared to the revenue of same quarter in last year, with a recovery of 70 per cent in September. 'After a gap of 1.5 years, the division has again started selling its products through Amazon and Flipkart, which is seeing a good response... 15 stores were added while 42 stores were closed by the division in the year to date, resulting in a net reduction of 27 stores,' the company said. Titan said the recovery rate for the fragrances and accessories business was around 50 per cent, dragged down by slow recovery of the two of the biggest channels, trade and large format stores (LFS). 'LFS has been slow on account of the lower walk-ins into malls. Trade has been slow mainly on account of the tight financial position of most dealers. E-commerce channel has done well,' Titan said.","Business, Companies","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/normalcy-returning-to-businessq2-jewellery-division-leads-recovery-titan_14343841.html

Jewellery sales have now reached 98% of pre-Covid levels (on a comparatively lower base), which were higher than the management&rsquo;s expectations of 80% recovery rate. Despite various headwinds, Titan continued on its store addition spree by opening 14 Tanishq stores in H1FY21 (eight stores added in Q2FY21). The liquidity stress faced by regional unorganised players can play out as an opportunity for Titan. Titan&rsquo;s healthy balance sheet will enable it to capture market share growth opportunities through healthy store additions. Watches division recovery is sluggish with sales reaching 55% of pre-Covid levels in Q2FY20 (September: 70%). Sustained investments over the last three years to enhance digital presence have started yielding positive results during tough times. Going forward, the overall demand trend for the festive season in Q3FY21E appears positive.

In 2015, ITC acquired Savlon&nbsp;and Shower to Shower from Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Johnson marking its entry into the health and hygiene space.

The consumer spending on Savlon in FY20 stood at Rs 250 crore, and Satpathy expects it to touch Rs 1,000 crore by the end of the current financial year (FY21) in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.  If that happens then Savlon will become the first Rs 1,000-crore brand in the personal care business for ITC.  &ldquo;When we acquired the brand, they only had soap and antiseptic liquid. Now we have Savlon Handwash, Savlon Hand Sanitiser, Savlon Multipurpose Disinfectant Cleaner, Savlon Wipes, Savlon Surface Disinfectant Spray.

Its production in second quarter increased by 54 percent QoQ, and 2 percent YoY, to 4.59 million tons.  The company noted that overall, steel consumption in India was down by 7.5 percent YoY, and production was down by 1.9 percent YoY.  Its peer JSW Steel also reported a jump in its crude steel production for the second quarter, and also in its capacity utilization. The company produced 3.85 million tons of steel in the quarter, slightly better than the 3.84 million tons in the same period last year. It was considerably higher, by 30 percent, quarter on quarter.  &amp;quot;With this the company has achieved average capacity utilisation of 86 percent in Q2 &rsquo;21 in line with pre Covid-19 level of 85 percent of last year Q2. This is a quantum jump from capacity utilisation of 66&nbsp;percent for Q1 &rsquo;21, which was impacted by the pandemic,&amp;quot; JSW Steel said in a statement.  Sectoral demand  This is what Tata Steel said about demand from some of the sectors that consume much of the steel produced in the country:  Automotive &amp;amp;amp; special products:&nbsp;segment deliveries grew 10 percent YoY with pick-up in sector demand especially in 2W and PV segment; we also gained Share of Business in the new PV and LCV launches  Branded products &amp;amp;amp; retail segment deliveries grew by 5 percent YoY with deliveries to B2ECA sector growing by 9 percent YoY; Tata Shaktee achieved a delivery volume growth of 22 percent YoY with robust rural demand.  Industrial products &amp;amp;amp; projects segment deliveries grew by 13 percent YoY. We achieved a 31 percent YoY growth in value added product deliveries within the segment as we continued to focus on product mix enrichment by catering to discerning customers in segments such as Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas, Lifting and Excavation and Precision Tubes.

249,2020-10-09 12:29:10+05:30,Hindustan Unilever Ltd.,HINDUNILVR,How HUL is dealing with sexual harassment and ensuring women are safe at the workplace and beyond,"Women employees are encouraged to complain about any sexual harassment without fear of retaliation. To prevent harassment and ensure their safety, women are encouraged to avoid late working hours. When one does work late, her line manager gets an automated alert. Female employees also have the option of having a male colleague escort them home if they leave office after 8:30 pm. ","In the 21st century, do working women need to be escorted home by their male colleagues after a long day at work that stretched late into the night? India&rsquo;s largest FMCG company&nbsp;Hindustan Unilever&nbsp;(HUL), known to be a trendsetter in HR practices, thinks so.  The FMCG giant, regarded as one of the most women-friendly companies in India, allows its female employees the option of having a male colleague escort them if they leave office after 8:30pm. It also encourages women professionals to avoid late working hours as much as possible.  As part of its HR practices against possible harassment, any instances of late working by women (beyond 8:30pm) are detected by the attendance card reader and sent to the employee&rsquo;s line manager automatically.  Moneycontrol spoke to two HUL women employees, who said that the company&rsquo;s policies have been designed for their safety. &ldquo;There are days when I had to stay back for work. The company drops us back home and hence we don&rsquo;t feel any hesitation in working late hours when required. It is always safer to opt for company transport than third-party aggregators,&rdquo; said one of the employees, who works in an office in the Delhi-NCR region.  Do men need to escort women home? Kolkata-based human resource consultant Madhushree Guha Roy questions why a woman should need to have a male staffer accompanying her in the vehicle till she is dropped home.  &ldquo;Women travel everywhere alone. Is it necessary to have a man tag along for safety? Companies having this practice could introspect,&rdquo; she said.  While there has been a debate over whether policies to have male colleagues escort women are restraining or liberating, a spokesperson clarified that at HUL, the policy is exercised at the discretion of the women.  Confirming this, an employee at HUL&rsquo;s Mumbai headquarters said: &ldquo;Not all women may seek to be accompanied by a male colleague while being dropped. However, some women do ask for a male colleague to escort them, hence it is an option provided.&rdquo;  HUL&rsquo;s Annual Report said that in circumstances where late working becomes unavoidable, women employees are required to take a drop home from a company-approved car vendor, be escorted by a male colleague and inform their line managers upon reaching home that they have reached safely.  HR practices, specifically on women&rsquo;s safety, have been under focus ever since the MeToo movement took off. More recently, the Hathras incident has re-ignited the debate on women&rsquo;s safety.  A&nbsp;Moneycontrol report showed&nbsp;that in FY20, seven years after the&nbsp;Sexual Harassment of Women at the Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH) was passed, there was an 8 percent&nbsp;increase in the number of cases of sexual harassment against women in&nbsp;Nifty50&nbsp;firms.  When it comes to the corporate world, companies have to strike a fine balance between what is politically right and ground realities.  How HUL handles PoSH cases While a layman would think that having zero cases is the ideal situation, human resource experts state that what needs to be looked at is whether a company has a culture of respect and fairness where women can report incidents fearlessly.  Among the Nifty50 companies, a&nbsp;total of 761 complaints&nbsp;of sexual harassment were filed in FY20.&nbsp;Hindustan Unilever&nbsp;(HUL) had a total of three complaints.  Of these, two were resolved in FY20 while one was pending. The HUL Annual Report said that the complaint pending as on March 31, 2020 was disposed of at the time of adoption of the annual report by the Board.  &ldquo;Disciplinary action is taken based on the facts of the case and as per the decision of the Internal Committee. Sanctions may range from a verbal counselling to a written warning / transfer, including termination,&rdquo; said an HUL company spokesperson.  Under the stipulations of the POSH Act, all companies are required to have an internal complaints committee (ICC) in place, and required to disclose data related to such cases annually.  HUL said in its annual report that the company endeavours to complete the inquiry process within the stipulated period of 90 days. The law states that an aggrieved woman has a time limit of three months to file the complaint to the internal committee in writing.  Continuous sensitisation In response to a query by Moneycontrol, an HUL company spokesperson said that continuous sensitisation sessions are held on respect, dignity and fair treatment across the organisation.  Here, awareness on the subject of POSH is conducted for all new recruits during induction sessions.  Human resource consultants are of the view that it is necessary for companies to promote a culture of openness from the top.  Independent HR consultant Jasudha Diwan told Moneycontrol that in POSH cases, it is the responsibility of the organisation to ensure that there is no unfair treatment of women who complain.  &ldquo;We have often noticed that there is a bias against women in the workplace in some companies once they complain against a male boss. This defeats the purpose of the POSH Act because it will dissuade more women from coming forward to report untoward incidents,&rdquo; she added.  HUL, however, has a speak-up culture and follows a strict anti-retaliation policy. Anti-retaliation means that there won&rsquo;t be any counter-action for reporting an incident. The company said that the global Policy on Respect, Dignity and Fair Treatment inter alia covers women&rsquo;s safety and anti-harassment and is followed uniformly across all Unilever entities, including HUL.  &ldquo;Multiple initiatives by way of tone from the top communications, regular cascades, communications encouraging all employees to raise concerns, socialising the channels available for reporting concerns and encouraging a speak-up culture with reassurance of support against potential retaliation are undertaken,&rdquo; said the company spokesperson.  There is also a periodic communication from the CEO and the senior management of the organisation encouraging employees to speak up with reassurance of support against potential retaliation.  Steps taken to promote fairness and respect for women HUL has women working in the supply chain as well as in office locations. For blue-collared women staff who may not be aware of sexual harassment laws, the company organises classroom training and town halls.  POSH related communication is common for all women employees, be it office staff or those who are part of the supply chain.  The HUL spokesperson said that all units follow the principles laid down in the Factories Act to prevent late working hours, especially after sunset.  Sought-after employer Moneycontrol spoke to three human resource consulting firms to seek a perspective on HUL&rsquo;s women-centric practices. All three said HUL is among the companies women prefer working for because of its female-friendly rules.  &ldquo;A lot of practices against sexual harassment are driven from the top, which is why one would find HUL remains a preferred brand for women job seekers,&rdquo; said the senior vice-president of a large HR firm. He spoke anonymously because company policies do not allow him to reveal his personal views on individual clients.  HUL said that it promotes higher reporting of cases both by employees and also by non-employees (third-party suppliers) by providing for anonymous reporting through online portals accessible internally and externally.  Since not all women may be comfortable with confiding about sexual harassment incidents with male bosses, HUL has a policy where female managers are encouraged to have discussions with women workers to ascertain any concerns on safety and well-being.","Business, Companies, HR, Posh","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/m-saraswathy-6837/', 'name': 'M Saraswathy'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/how-hul-is-dealingsexual-harassmentensuring-womensafe-atworkplacebeyond_14350621.html

Our optimism on TTAN has been elevated by 1) faster than expected rebound in Jewellery sales (98% in 2Q) led by wedding segment and 2) improved competitive position of TTAN in post Covid scenario. TTAN has near term headwinds like 1) Cutback in discretionary spends 2) 40% higher gold prices and 3) heavy discounting by local jewellery chains, however we expect TTAN to gain market share led by 1) accelerated industry consolidation (not even marginal players but even organized players shut stores) 2) assured volumes under GHS (20-25% of sales 3) strong balance sheet 4) ability to open stores even in tiring times (14 added in 1H21) 5) franchisee based model and 6) implementation of Hall marking in 2021.

As per the latest Enforcement Report of the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), Sun Pharmaceutical Industries is recalling the bottles of RIOMET ER (metformin hydrochloride for extended-release oral suspension) in the American market.  As per the USFDA, the company is recalling the product due to deviation from the current good manufacturing practices (CGMP) -- detection of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) impurity in finished drug product.  The product has been manufactured at Sun Pharma''s Mohali-based manufacturing plant and is being recalled by its US-based subsidiary.  The company initiated the recall on September 23, the USFDA said.  The US health regulator has classified it as a Class-II recall, which is initiated in a &amp;quot;situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote&amp;quot;.  Metformin Hydrochloride extended-release suspension is a prescription oral medication indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve blood glucose control in adults with type-2 diabetes mellitus.  Various companies across the globe have announced similar recalls for the product after the USFDA pointed out presence of NDMA above permissible limits.  In July this year, Lupin and Granules India had also recalled close to 9.71 lakh bottles of generic diabetes drug in the US for the similar reason.  FDA''s testing has shown elevated levels of NDMA in some extended release (ER) metformin formulation, but not in the immediate release (IR) formulation or in the active pharmaceutical ingredient.  NDMA is classified as a probable human carcinogen based on results from laboratory tests. It is a known environmental contaminant and found in water and food, including meats, dairy products and vegetables.  In a separate note, the USFDA said Strides Pharma Inc, a unit of Bengaluru-based Strides Pharma Science Ltd, is recalling 11,280 bottles of Potassium Chloride extended-release rablets due to &amp;quot;failed dissolution specifications&amp;quot;.

The urban markets, especially the metros, are not fully operationalised. While the rural market returned to normalcy in the last few months, the semi-urban was back to business by August,&amp;quot; STFC MD &amp;amp; CEO Umesh Revankar said in an interaction.","Shriram Transport Finance Company (STFC) expects its assets under management (AUM) to remain flat in the ongoing fiscal and post a double-digit growth next fiscal, a top company official said.  &amp;quot;Overall business has picked up in semi-urban and rural markets, I should say it has come to normal. The urban markets, especially the metros, are not fully operationalised. While the rural market returned to normalcy in the last few months, the semi-urban was back to business by August,&amp;quot; STFC MD &amp;amp;amp; CEO Umesh Revankar said in an interaction.  As 90 per cent of its branches are in non-urban areas, the company has not been impacted much by the COVID-19 pandemic, he added.  However, the company expects its AUM to remain flat in the ongoing fiscal, Revankar said.  &amp;quot;The kind of spread of pandemic in big cities may not happen in rural areas. We should be able to come back to pre-COVID level in the October-December quarter. So this year we are looking at a flat growth in our AUM and next year (2021-22) we are expected to grow at a double-digit growth,&amp;quot; he said.  In the fiscal ended March 2020, the non-banking financial company (NBFC) had seen its AUM grow by 5 per cent to Rs 1,09,750 crore.  The company can see a higher growth in the second half of 2021-22, he said.  &amp;quot;We feel that in the next year, the business will be much higher because of pent-up demand and the infrastructure sector spending by the government will trigger a lot of demand,&amp;quot; Revankar said.  He said there has been a solid recovery in the rural and semi-urban market, while urban markets are seeing gradual improvement.  The company is witnessing strong demand for loans for light commercial vehicles (LCVs), intermediate commercial vehicles (ICVs), tractors as well as private passenger vehicles.  Besides, resale prices of used vehicles, LCVs and private passenger vehicles have gone higher than pre-COVID levels, which is good for the company as it indicates good demand, he said.  Speaking about the much awaited scrappage policy, Revankar said the company stands to benefit if the government comes up with some incentives for scrapping old vehicles.  &amp;quot;It is unknown as of now (about the policy). But whatever the cabinet approves...it would have to be seen if the government is giving any incentive for scrapping vehicles or not. For say there is no incentive, then there is a challenge for people who want to scrap their vehicles,&amp;quot; he said.  Explaining further, he said, &amp;quot;Say there is a scrappage policy for 20 years old vehicles, then a person who wants to discard that vehicle would like to buy another used vehicle (rather) than to buy a new vehicle.&amp;quot;  The demand for old vehicles, about 5-10 years old, is increasing and it is an opportunity for the company to grow its business.  Revankar said the one-time loan restructuring will have a miniscule impact on the company as only 3 per cent of STFC''s customers have asked for loan restructuring, which accounts for less than 2 per cent of its loanbook.  Besides, STFC has offered 3-6 months small EMI facility to ease the burden on segments like tourism, travel and staff transportation, which have been affected by the pandemic, and expects the situation to normalise by December, he added.  The company has made adequate provisions and there might not be a need for further provisioning related to restructuring, Revankar said, adding that the only thing to watch is if there is a second wave of coronavirus infections.","Business, Companies","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/expect-aum-to-remain-flatfy21-post-double-digit-growthfy22-shriram-transport-finance_14355361.html
256,2020-10-12 07:18:55+05:30,Grasim Industries Ltd.,GRASIM,"Hot Stocks | SBI, UBL two buy calls for short term, sell on Grasim; here's why","As far as levels are concerned, the base has shifted higher and the previous resistance area of 11,700&ndash; 11,450 should now be treated as strong support.","  We have seen a spectacular comeback by the bulls after the recent fall towards 10,800.  In the week gone by, the market just took off with the help of a few heavyweights.  Initially, it was the IT space that took the charge and lifted markets higher from the critical levels along with some participation from the banking space.  Any robust rally in the market is incomplete without the contribution of the banking space. Last Friday, post the RBI policy, banking stocks attracted tremendous buying interest to eventually end the week at a new seven-month high for Nifty above the 11,900-mark.  In the last couple of weeks&rsquo; rally, global markets played a major part as we are seeing some gravity-defying moves despite some in-between uncertainty.  The way Nifty surpassed the August 31 high of 11,794 with some authority and it is now within the kissing distance of 12,000, the positivity is likely to extend further.  Importantly, the banking space has some dominance which is very much in favour of the bulls. It may provide an impetus for the extended rally.  Now, the only missing factor is the participation from the broader market.  If we look at the Nifty Midcap index, in the last 7-8 sessions, they remained muted throughout and only a handful of heavyweight names lifted the market higher.  Hence, if the Midcap index breaks out from the recent congestion, it will be considered as a healthy rally.  As far as levels are concerned, the base has shifted higher and the previous resistance area of 11,700&ndash; 11,450 should now be treated as strong support.  On the flip side, we are very much close to the psychological mark of 12,000. The moment it is taken out, we may see a steady move towards 12,200&ndash;12,400 levels.  Since the banking index is back to 200-day SMA on the daily chart and the way it closed with a complete gush in the space, a move beyond 24,000 would provide strong support to the benchmark index.  However, we would like to highlight that since the move is extremely swift, we can see some intraday profit-booking anytime and hence, one needs to position accordingly and be very fussy in stock-selection.  Here are two buy and one sell call for this week:  State Bank Of India (SBI) | Buy | LTP: Rs 198.55 | Target price: Rs 208 - 212 | Stop loss: Rs 192 | Upside: 7%  Last Friday, we had a stupendous move in the banking conglomerates and the most underperforming PSU banking space, too, participated aggressively in it.  SBI, being the giant and trusted PSB of the lot, has managed to break out after a long phase of consolidation.  Due to the tail-end surge, the stock prices managed to traverse the 89-EMA on the daily chart with sizable volumes.  In addition, we can witness a positive crossover in the combination of 5 and 20 EMA which indicates the possibility of an up-move this week.  United Breweries (UBL) | Buy | LTP: Rs 991 | Target price: Rs 1,035 | Stop loss: Rs 964 | Upside: 4%  As we stepped into &lsquo;Unlock 5.0&rsquo;, the government eased a lot of restrictions on restaurants and bars. Hence, the liquor stocks saw some buying traction post this development.  Recently, UBL had undergone some selling over the past few weeks and after a brief pause, we witnessed a sudden spike in the stock prices.  If we look at the volume activity, we are seeing a decent rise, providing credence to the move.  This may not be the complete trend reversal but at least we can see a short-term bounce in the stock. Hence, we recommend going long for a target of Rs.1035 in the coming days. The stop loss can be placed at Rs.964  Grasim Industries | Sell | LTP: Rs 749.60 | Target price: Rs 715 | Stop loss: Rs 773 | Downside: 5%  In the last couple of weeks, the entire cement space had a stellar move and Grasim being the holding company of cement giant Ultratech Cement, did not move to the tune of it.  This sluggishness finally resulted in a profit-booking last Friday and despite the benchmark hitting a new seven-month high, this stock had a weak close.  The daily chart now resembles a &lsquo;Hanging Man&rsquo; pattern (formed on Thursday), which got confirmed on a closing basis as well.  Looking at these observations, we expect the stock to underperform and witness further profit-booking in the forthcoming week.  Hence, momentum traders can look to sell on a bounce around Rs 752-755 for a target of Rs 715 in the coming days.

Large deal wins and easing of supply-side constraints may boost topline.  The constant currency revenue growth could be around 2 percent QoQ, while profit is expected to grow in the range of 4-9 percent backed by revenue and stable EBIT margin.  &amp;quot;We expect constant revenue growth of 2 percent QoQ and cross-currency tailwind of around 150 bps. In USD terms, we expect revenue to grow by 3.5 percent QoQ. Growth is expected to be driven by large deal wins, easing of supply-side constraints, and recovery in consumer, technology, communication, and healthcare verticals,&amp;quot; said Sharekhan which sees 9 percent growth in consolidated profit.  Kotak Institutional Equities also expects sequential constant currency revenue growth of 2 percent and cross-currency tailwind of 145 bps. Wipro has announced many large deals in the past three months, some of which have ramped up in the quarter and will lead to robust performance, it feels.  The brokerage expects stable EBIT margin on a sequential basis and an increase in the margin on year-on-year&nbsp;basis. &amp;quot;Margins even have scope for expansion noting lack of headwinds and tailwinds from growth and elimination of supply-side constraints on revenues.&amp;quot;  Given the large deal wins, brokerages largely feel Wipro may give a guidance for Q3FY21.  Key things to watch out for would be new CEO Thierry Delaporte's strategy; buyback details; commentary on consumer business unit, energy natural resources, and utilities in lieu of lower crude prices; margin trajectory and pricing pressure; and deal win momentum.  &amp;quot;Wipro's payout policy is close to 50 percent of net profit expected largely through buyback of shares. Wipro completed its last buyback in mid-September 2019. Regulations require a cooling off period of 12-months before the next buyback announcement. Investors will look forward to the buyback announcement,&amp;quot; Kotak said.  Earnings preview is only for the IT services business.  The stock on Friday ahead of its quarterly earnings hit a record closing high of Rs 374.10 on the BSE, up 4 percent. It shot up 130 percent from its March lows.","Result Poll, Wipro","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/result-poll/wipro-expected-to-announce-q2-earnings-today-herekey-things-to-watch-for_14356361.html
258,2020-10-12 09:21:57+05:30,Eicher Motors Ltd.,EICHERMOT,"Exclusive: In 3 years, Aprilia to get into 300-cc bike category, says Piaggio Vehicles CMD Diego Graffi","Diego Graffi, chairman and managing director, Piaggio Vehicles, said that the &lsquo;affordable premium&rsquo; segment of motorcycles, having engines up to 350cc has been growing. Aprilia also sells 1,000cc superbikes in India in limited numbers.","Aprilia, the performance bike brand from the house of Piaggio, will enter the 250-300cc motorcycle segment in the next three years to join a host of competing brands, a top company official has confirmed.  Currently, Aprilia does not have bikes in the 250cc-300cc category. In all probability, India could become a lead country in the development of such a bike, much like the development and launch of the SR 125 scooter, the first scooter under the Aprilia brand, which was launched in India a few years ago.  The Italian superbike brand is known for performance bikes, having won several international racing championship titles, including MotoGP. Affordable premium segment growing  Talking to&nbsp;Moneycontrol,&nbsp;Diego Graffi, chairman and managing director, Piaggio Vehicles, said that the &lsquo;affordable premium&rsquo; segment of motorcycles, having engines up to 350cc has been growing favourably and would most likely become a hunting ground for the company.  The same segment saw Japanese heavyweight Honda relaunch itself with the H&rsquo;ness CB350, less than two weeks ago. The new Honda model is set to take on the unchallenged dominance of&nbsp;Eicher Motors-controlled Royal Enfield.  Piaggio is present in India&rsquo;s two-wheeler space only with scooters through the Vespa and Aprilia brands. Aprilia also sells 1,000cc superbikes in India in limited numbers. Piaggio targeted entering the 150cc bike space using the Aprilia brand to take on the segment leader Pulsar made by&nbsp;Bajaj Auto showcased at 2018 Auto Expo.  Piaggio even showcased a couple of Aprilia bikes powered by 150cc engines at the 2018 Auto Expo, and promised to launch them later the same year. But Piaggio developed cold feet following the slowdown in demand, which started in 2018 and spilled over to 2019.  &ldquo;The response we got for the twin 150cc bikes at the 2018 Auto Expo was very positive. And that gave us the confidence that entering the mid-range motorbike segment with the Aprilia brand in India makes a lot of sense. But the growth in the 150cc segment has not been as steep as we expected. This made us to look at other opportunities,&rdquo; said Graffi.  The RS 150 and Tuono 150 were the scaled-down versions of two of Aprilia&rsquo;s internationally most popular performance bikes, RSV4 and Tuono V4, respectively.  Though these were to be powered by a single cylinder, 18bhp, liquid-cooled 150cc engine, they are designed and styled on the lines of their bigger siblings, both of which are powered by 1,000cc engines.  &ldquo;We are instead looking at a higher 250-300cc segment. In the next three years, the Indian market will see a motorcycle under the Aprilia brand. We are taking our time because we want to be coherent with our mission and profile, which is to be different and premium and deliver a performance which is not seen in that segment and all this takes time but the product will come,&rdquo; added Graffi.  During FY20, Piaggio sold 62,638 two-wheelers in India, a fall of nearly 20 percent compared to FY19. The company had a market share of 0.35 percent in the domestic market, as per data shared by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.  &ldquo;We do not want to chase sales numbers. We would rather deliver on the promise of what Aprilia stands for, which is performance,&rdquo; added Graffi.","Auto, Business, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/in-3-years-aprilia-to-get-into-300-cc-bike-category_14356841.html

262,2020-10-13 09:00:35+05:30,Tata Steel Ltd.,TATASTEEL,"With the backing of ArcelorMittal, Nippon Steel, AM/NS charts a new growth plan in India","Talking to Moneycontrol, CEO Dilip Oommen said that AM/NS (formerly Essar Steel) may diversify into long steel. He also commented on the company's interest in Uttam Galva Steels","With two parents that produce 10 percent of the world&rsquo;s steel and have access to the latest technology, ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India is going through a transformation across its product portfolio, key functions, and even a new office that is in the works in Mumbai.  One of the biggest changes for the company, which was earlier known as Essar Steel, will be diversifying into making long steel that is used in construction and infrastructure industries. Ever since it was set up in 1998, the steelmaker has specialised in making flat steel that is used by auto and white goods companies.  &ldquo;We have an eye on long products in India,&rdquo; Dilip Oommen, CEO, ArcelorMittal&nbsp;Nippon&nbsp;Steel India (AM/NS), told Moneycontrol. The company is in talks with two state governments to buy land, to set up a new facility. Oommen declined to share more details, saying the plans are on the drawing board.  The present facility in Hazira, Gujarat, is one of the biggest standalone units in the world making flat steel. It has an annual capacity to make 10 million tons of steel.  A diversification into long steel is understandable as the 2017 National Steel Policy points out that nearly 60 percent of the metal's consumption will come from construction and infrastructure sectors by 2030, up from 40 percent. AM/NS will square up against the industry leaders, Tata Steel and JSW Steel, who dominate the segment at present.  Both ArcelorMittal - the world's largest steelmaker - and Nippon Steel, Japan's biggest, are major producers of long steel. The two steelmakers had come together to bid for Essar Steel, which was admitted to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The joint venture was declared the new owner in December 2019.  At the time, the company had announced that it plans to increase AM/NS's capacity to 12 million tons to 15 million tons per year in the long run.  &ldquo;Apart from the huge volumes that they produce, between the two of them, ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel also make some of the most high-end steel products in the industry...it's the best thing that could have happened,&amp;quot; says Oommen, of the change in ownership.  The expansion sits well with the vision of LN Mittal, Chairman and CEO of ArcelorMittal, who had for long wanted to set up mega facilities in his home country. But his much-hoped project in Odisha got stuck and was shelved. Through AM/NS, he now has the opportunity to expand in a market where demand for steel - despite the current problems from COVID-19 - is expected to grow among the fastest in the world. In most of the other regions in the world, ArcelorMittal is re-looking at its capacity and has even pruned in some.  Product portfolio to expand  Explaining on the scope to expand the company's present product&nbsp;basket, including both long and flat products, Oommen said many of the specialised steel that is currently imported, can be produced locally.  &amp;quot;India imports line pipes. Also, a lot of high value steel used in the auto sector is also imported, so is electrical steel. All this can be substituted and produced in India,&amp;quot; said Oommen, who has been&nbsp;with the company since 2003.    &amp;quot;Our offerings will go up, and several products will be launched. The COVID-19 pandemic has delayed things by a bit. But it will again gain speed,&amp;quot; said the steel veteran who has been in the industry for 37 years.  On the impact of the virus, Oommen said that the company may not match last year's output, which was 7.23 million tons. This year, it could be lower by about 4 lakh tons. The company, which had cut down on its production to the bare minimum post the nationwide lockdown in end-March, had brought it back to full capacity by the mid of May.  &amp;quot;Our&nbsp; EBITDA, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and ammortisation, will be much better in the third quarter,&amp;quot; Oommen said.  AM/NS, like ArcelorMittal, follows a calendar year.&nbsp; In the second quarter, its EBITDA fell by 23.5 percent to $107 million&nbsp;in&nbsp;the quarter ending June 30 from $140 million in the&nbsp;previous&nbsp;quarter. Steel production was down 29 percent to 1.2 million tonnes, as compared to 1.7 million tonnes in the first quarter.  &amp;quot;Certain segments have shown good improvement. These include the passenger vehicles&nbsp; and tractors. Commercial vehicles is an area of concern,&amp;quot; Oommen said on the demand outlook.  Interest in Uttam Galva Steels  During its bid for Essar Steel, ArcelorMittal had paid over Rs 6,500 crore to clear the debt of Uttam Galva Steels, in which it had bought a stake in 2009. The world's largest steelmaker had made the payment to qualify to bid for Essar Steel, as&nbsp;under insolvency laws, promoters of defaulting companies were barred from placing bids.  Uttam Galva was again in news recently when its lead lender State Bank of India took the company to the NCLT.  While Oommen didn't specifically comment, he said AM/NS is interested in &amp;quot;any project that will add value,&amp;quot; and that &amp;quot;it will follow due process under NCLT.&amp;quot;  New corporate building  AM/NS, after the ownership change, moved into a new corporate office in Mumbai. By all accounts it will be a temporary one.  Oommen said the company plans to have a new building that will house its India headquarters. The new office will be made of steel, much like what ArceloMittal is building in Luxembourg. The new world headquarters will use 6,000 tons of steel.  The India office may take some more time as further details are being finalised.","AMNS, Business, Companies","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/prince-mathews-thomas-7633/', 'name': 'Prince Mathews Thomas'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/withbackingarcelormittal-nippon-steel-amns-chartsnew-growth-planindia_14360541.html
263,2020-10-13 09:18:32+05:30,Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd.,M&M," Bharat vs India: Tractor sales in 2020 could become the best-ever in a year; car, CV segments still in the...","Tractor Manufacturers Association attributes growth to better agricultural harvest, government&rsquo;s rural development schemes, higher MSP. Manufacturers are now expecting sales in the rest of the year to surpass even the 2018 figures, making it the best in a year so far. ","Domestic tractor sales between January and September have surpassed the sales of the corresponding period in 2019, becoming the first segment to achieve the feat this year.  Car and SUV, two-wheeler, commercial vehicle and three-wheeler segments are still in the red on a cumulative basis, till September.  Record improvement in agricultural harvest, government&rsquo;s rural development schemes, higher Minimum Support Price (MSP) and record water levels in reservoirs have resulted in a 5 percent increase in domestic tractor sales till September, as per data shared by the Tractor Manufacturers Association (TMA).  In fact, the&nbsp;Q1FY21 GDP&nbsp;data had highlighted the agricultural growth story. For the first time in India&rsquo;s recorded statistical history, of all the eight GDP segments, only the agriculture sector showed growth during the April-June quarter of 2020.  The industry recorded sales of 543,936 units during January-September 2020 against 519,398 in the same period last year. In 2018, the industry closed the same nine months with sales of 579,878 units. India is the biggest market for tractors in the world, followed by China.  September sales hit two-year high &nbsp; September sales this year were almost at a two-year high. October typically churns out the highest tractor volumes in a year owing to the festive days. Manufacturers are expecting sales in the last three months of the year to surpass the sales of not just last year, but of 2018, too, thus making it the best sales in a year so far.  &ldquo;A bumper harvest this year is keeping the (tractor) production lines busy. If not for the lockdown in April, sales this year would have beaten the sales of even 2018 by now. We have more than doubled our growth estimates for the year, and we should be able to beat the sales of 2018, making it the best year for tractors ever,&rdquo; said a senior executive of one of India&rsquo;s dozen-odd tractor manufacturers.  In the whole of 2019, the industry sold 723,525 tractors in the domestic market, while, in 2018, the industry achieved its best-ever domestic sales of 796,932 units. In 2017, total domestic sales stood at 659,304 units, as per TMA data.  ICRA revises growth  Shamsher Dewan, Vice President, rating agency ICRA, said, &ldquo;The strong revival in tractor volumes were aided by healthy rabi cash flows across regions and progress of monsoon (in line with forecasts). Further, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) have been ramping up production levels to stock inventory, ahead of the festive season and are gearing up for healthy sales for the rest of the year.&rdquo;  ICRA has upwardly revised its industry growth forecast to 7-9 percent in FY2021 from an earlier estimate of 2-4 percent, which was due to the uncertainty regarding the impact of the pandemic on the farming community.  While this uncertainty still continues, the rural agricultural scenario, which matters more for robust tractor demand, is supportive of growth. Kharif sowing has witnessed record progress of areas covered. So far in&nbsp;2020, 1,116.88 lakh hectares have been sown compared to 1,066.06 lakh hectares in&nbsp;2019.  Market share swings  The strong pick-up in volumes has allowed tractor manufacturers to go after market share. International Tractors Ltd (ITL), which sells the Sonalika brand of tractors, mostly in the north of the country, emerged as one of the biggest market share gainers during July-September.  ITL improved its domestic retail market share to 12.8 percent by the end of September as compared to 11.8 percent by the end of July, according to data shared by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association, which sources data from 86 percent of India&rsquo;s Regional Transport Offices (RTOs).  Market leader&nbsp;Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra&nbsp;lost its market share during the same period. The Mumbai-based company, which sells the Mahindra and Swaraj brand of tractors, closed September with a share of 39.47 percent against the 40.5 percent recorded in July.","Auto, Business, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/bharat-vs-india-tractor-sales2020-could-becomebest-evera-year-car-cv-segments-stillthe-red_14360581.html
264,2020-10-13 15:46:51+05:30,Cipla Ltd.,CIPLA,"Covid medicines help Cipla, Glenmark post strong sales growth in a subdued pharma market",The recovery was led by easing of lockdown restrictions and resumption of non-Covid related treatments.,"The long-standing Covid-19 pandemic may have spread much gloom across industries,&nbsp;but there are some&nbsp;that have reason to&nbsp;cheer. Among&nbsp; the pharma big-names,&nbsp;Cipla,&nbsp;Glenmark&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ajanta Pharma&nbsp;have emerged as outliers, posting double-digit growth rates in Q2FY21.  Covid drugs such as Remdesivir, Favipiravir&nbsp;and&nbsp;Azithromycin, among others, helped both Cipla and Glenmark post strong&nbsp;growth in sales&nbsp;during the quarter.  Cipla's sales rose 11.5 percent year-on-year (YoY),&nbsp;driven by&nbsp;respiratory brands Duolin, Montair Lc, Asthalin and Aerocort,&nbsp;which grew at healthy double digits, while Azithromycin brand Azee, which is widely prescribed for Covid-19,&nbsp;recorded a 42 percent rise. Respiratory and anti-infectives form about 56 percent of Cipla's sales.  Glenmark's&nbsp; sales rose 32 percent, led by Covid antiviral drug Fabiflu. &amp;quot;Fabiflu continues to be the third largest contributor to overall sales. Also, other brands such as Telma, Candid, and Candid B supported growth,&amp;quot; said Motilal Oswal in its report. Ajanta Pharma's sales grew 12.1 due to strong demand&nbsp; for the company's cardiac brands.  Others in the industry,&nbsp;however,&nbsp; did not fare well.&nbsp;Sales of market leader&nbsp;Sun Pharma, according to data from market research firm AIOCD, showed a decline of 3.3 percent,&nbsp;while&nbsp;Dr Reddy's&nbsp;dropped 0.3 percent and&nbsp;Lupin&nbsp;remained flat.  Slow recovery  The Indian pharmaceutical market (IPM) grew at 1 percent year-on-year (YoY) in Q2FY21, making a&nbsp;partial recovery from the slump witnessed in the first quarter, according to data released by AIOCD.&nbsp; The recovery was led by easing of lockdown restrictions and resumption of non-Covid related treatments.  In Q1FY21, IPM contracted nearly 6 percent due to preemptive buying in March and lockdowns that hit delivery of healthcare services. The market recovery has been more prominent in September, when IPM grew 4.5 percent YoY.  The volumes fell 6.5 percent, while price growth remained almost muted at 4.6 percent. While drugs for treating chronic diseases such as cardiovascular and diabetes managed to beat the slump, sales of anti-infectives, respiratory, pain management and gastrointestinal medications remained under pressure.  &amp;quot;Next half will continue to subdued, the recovery has come due to whatever little anti-Covid medications which are very high value, but their absolute units are very low,&amp;quot; said Ameesh Masurekar, Director, AIOCD Pharmasofttech AWACS Pvt Ltd.  &amp;quot;Because of the semi lockdown conditions, precautions, work from home still going on, the routine infections are still much lower than last year level, because of that anti-infective sales, associated co-therapies such as gastro, pain and analgesics also get impacted,&amp;quot;&nbsp;he added.  Masurekar expects IPM growth to be in the range of 3-5 percent in the second half.  The anti-infective, gastro and pain&nbsp;segments&nbsp;together constitute about one-third of the Indian pharmaceutical market, which is around Rs 1.43 lakh crores.  The anti-infective segment -- around 13-14 percent of the market&nbsp; -- saw sales declining by 6.3 percent in Q2FY21. Pain segment declined 6.8 percent and gastrointestinal managed to grow at 0.3 percent.  Sales of vitamins have picked up,&nbsp;reporting a growth of&nbsp; 9 percent during the second quarter.  For the year ended September 30,&nbsp;the&nbsp;domestic pharma market grew at 3.5 percent. India pharma traditionally grew at 10 percent and above, with&nbsp;the&nbsp;exception of a slowdown during the rollout of Goods and Services Tax (GST).","Business, Companies, coronavirus, Health","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/viswanath-pilla-6848/', 'name': 'Viswanath Pilla'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/covid-medicines-help-cipla-glenmark-post-strong-sales-growtha-subdued-pharma-market_14362581.html

Car rental firm Zoomcar and Uber have tied up online grocers for deliveries. Meanwhile Adidas has tied up with MacDonald&rsquo;s for a sneaker range and Dabur has partnered SIS for personal protective equipment ","The next time you order food using an app, you can also order groceries. In a bid to reach out to consumers, most FMCG companies have formed partnerships for delivery of essentials as customers have been avoiding stepping out for fear of getting infected with the deadly Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus.  In the past few months, FMCG companies ITC, Marico and Godrej Consumer Products, among others, have partnered with food service aggregators Zomato and Swiggy, as well as delivery services Dunzo and Scootsy.  Brand experts, however, see this more as a matter of opportunity rather than a collaboration.  &ldquo;Brands are coming together and trying to create marketplace access wherever they can. Covid has proven that you cannot be a specialist anymore. You need to be a generalist. Tie-ups will help brands create effectiveness of value, service, cost,&rdquo; said&nbsp;N Chandramouli, CEO of TRA Research, a consumer analytics and brand insights company.   &nbsp;Unusual tie-ups The country has also witnessed some unsual partnerships in the FMCG space, wherein even cab aggregators and car rental firms have joined hands.  Adidas has tied up with McDonalds: The two brands have joined hands to put out a collection of three sneakers inspired by the heritage of both brands under the title 'The Sauce Pack'.  The three sneakers will be inspired by popular basketball legends James Harden, Damian Lillard and Tracy McGrady, as well as famous sauces sold at McDonald's outlets globally.  Another&nbsp;unusual&nbsp;tie-up is between&nbsp;Dabur and SIS&nbsp;for supply of PPEs, including masks and gloves. The companies have launched a Covid-19 Safety Kit, which comes with different kinds of masks, gloves and sanitisers. SIS is known for its security business and facilities management.  Car rental firm&nbsp;Zoomcar&nbsp;has also joined the bandwagon, tying up with&nbsp;Bigbasket, Grofers and Milkbasket&nbsp;for last-mile delivery of essentials. Cab aggregator Uber, too, has tied up with Bigbasket.  &nbsp;Harnessing synergies Brand guru Harish Bijoor, feels that unusual partnerships happen during unusual times.&nbsp;&ldquo;The most disparate looking brands wed in such times. The idea is all about reaching out to the consumer using the collective synergies of brands so conjoined.&nbsp; Consumers appreciate the effort and both sets of brands accrue positive strokes,&rdquo; said Bijoor, founder of Harish Bijoor Consults Inc.  Pavan Padaki, branding coach and consultant, believes that the traditional way of viewing products and services as two distinct baskets of business seems to be a thing of the past.  He pointed out that it is now more about fulfilment or answering a need in totality, either adding a service to a product or adding a product in a service business to make it a complete&nbsp;and a wholesome&nbsp;proposition.  This product-cum-service combo delivery not only helps differentiate and fight competition but also helps garner new customers.  In the coming days, many unusual partnerships could end up becoming business as usual, Padaki said.","Business, Godrej Consumer Products, ITC, Marico, Swiggy, Zomato","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/himadri-buch-6865/', 'name': 'Himadri Buch'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/deliveringgoods-how-companiesforming-unusual-partnerships-to-connectcustomers_14365821.html

The bullish Harami pattern formed in the previous week is still valid and the index is trading well below the said pattern.  Maximum Call OI of 23.35 lakh contracts was seen at 12,500 strikes which will act as crucial resistance in the October series.  Maximum Put OI of 24.08 lakh contracts was seen at 11,500 strikes which will act as crucial support in the October series.  Bank Nifty recovered more than 600 points from the day&rsquo;s low and has engulfed its previous day's red candle on a daily timeframe.  Bank Nifty, on the daily chart, is trading above its 21, 50 &amp;amp;amp; 100 EMA. On the weekly chart, the index still floats below its said averages.  This indicates one needs to cross the 25,000-mark on the broader timeframe to change the trend from sideways to bullish.  The short-lived correction is probably over and the benchmark index is ready for its next leg of impulse wave which will stretch Nifty to trade above the 12,000-mark.  In the case of any decline, the index will continue to find support around 11,800 - 11,750 levels, which coincides with runaway gap supports.  However, a stable move above 12,000 levels will invalidate resistance and it will strengthen the index till 12,250 levels in the coming weeks.  Here are two buy calls for the short-term:  UltraTech Cement | LTP: Rs 4,459 | Target price: Rs 4,880 | Stop loss: Rs 4,200 | Upside: 9%  On October 8, the stock prices finally managed to surpass the multiple resistance zones around Rs 4,200 &ndash;4,250 which eventually confirmed an ascending triangle pattern breakout on the daily interval.  Since the breakout, the stock has been consolidating above its trendline support and is likely to complete its throwback.  The recent leg of strong up-move is also supported by strong volumes and it also resembles a strong consolidation breakout.  Prices are above the 50 and 100-day exponential moving averages on the weekly chart.  Momentum oscillator RSI (14) is reading near 60 levels with positive crossover, which is positive for the counter.  The MACD indicator is reading above its line of polarity with positive sentiments.  HDFC | LTP: Rs 1,978.10 | Target price: Rs 2,120 | Stop loss: Rs 1,900 | Upside: 7%  On the daily chart, HDFC has given a breakout of the consolidation pattern and sustained above all its major exponential moving averages.  The stock had been in the consolidation mode for the last couple of months and a recent breakout has pushed the price above its horizontal trendline resistance on a daily scale.  A bullish candle formed on the weekly candle has closed above its previous several weeks high.  The majority of indicators and oscillators are showing a positive trend for the current scenario.

The company impressed with a second consecutive quarter of strong margin expansion (270bp QoQ in 2Q; ~420bp over 1HFY21). We expect some margin benefits to be sustainable (driven by automation, etc.). On the other hand, tailwinds (such as increased offshoring, lower attrition, deferred wage hikes, and lower travel/SGA costs) as a result of the pandemic are likely to partly wane out later on as the situation normalizes further over the next few quarters. The highest ever deal wins were reported (~USD3.15b), and the deal pipeline remains healthy. Upward revision to FY21 guidance &ndash; with revenue growth of 2&ndash;3% YoY CC (v/s 0&ndash;2% earlier) and margin guidance of 23&ndash;24% (v/s 21&ndash;23% earlier) &ndash; is positive, but still conservative. We expect Infosys to deliver above guidance in FY21 a) notwithstanding margin headwinds (wage hikes in 4Q, large deal ramp-up, seasonality, above margin factors, etc.) and b) based on strong deal wins. We upgrade our FY21/FY22E EPS estimates by 9%/12% as we adjust our revenue and EBIT margin trajectory. Infosys should be a key beneficiary in terms of recovery in IT spends in FY22. Additionally, leading operational performance in 1HFY21, coupled with strong deal wins, should translate to strong outperformance on EPS growth (v/s the sector). Reiterate Buy. Outlook As Infosys has outperformed TCS in 1HFY21 and is on its way to an industry-leading performance in FY21 (amongst Tier I), we expect the divergence in the valuation to narrow (to 10%). On our revised estimates, the stock is currently trading at 21x FY22 EPS. We value the stock at 25x FY22E EPS (10% discount to TCS). Reiterate Buy.

293,2020-10-15 17:59:24+05:30,Hindustan Unilever Ltd.,HINDUNILVR,"COVID-19 impact: Germ-protection market gets crowded, but it&rsquo;s not all about minting money","While some experts say it makes business sense, others argue that it is important for companies to enter the segment to ensure that loyal and potential customers don&rsquo;t go to other brands to solve new needs. Tata Consumer is the latest entrant into the segment.","The germ-protection soap market is getting crowded. Tata Consumer recently joined the market. Major brands like ITC, Reckitt Benckiser, and Hindustan Unilever are already present there. In fact, ITC is planning more launches.  Is this just a mad rush to grab market share or is there more to it?&nbsp;Moneycontrol&nbsp;spoke to a few brand analysts and experts to find out.  &lsquo;It makes business sense&rsquo; Some brand experts do see business sense in it. In the current germ-protection-obsessed market, it makes immense sense to market soaps in any avatar, promising hygiene and germ protection.  &ldquo;Most FMCG companies have expanded their range during COVID. Anybody who had a chance to move in to areas anti-bacterial or germ has launched it,&rdquo; said N Chandramouli, CEO of TRA Research, a consumer analytics and brand insights company.  Figures support the argument. The Indian&nbsp;soap market, which was worth $2.9 billion&nbsp;in FY20, is estimated to cross $4.4 billion&nbsp;by FY26 due to the increasing focus on maintaining proper hygiene and rising disposable incomes.  &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not just about money&rsquo; Pavan Padaki, a brand consultant and coach, presented a different angle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just about making money. From a brand point of view, it is important to stay relevant to the current customer base and needs. Companies have to ensure that their customers don&rsquo;t look at other brands to solve new needs. This is required to fence both its loyal and potential customers,&rdquo; he said.  From a business point of view, brands are adding another potential hot-seller to existing categories, which are well-established with robust distribution chain and channels to gain immediate and profitable ROIs (Return on Investment),&rdquo; added Padaki.  In fact, some analysts see a different potential here. The current market potential for hygiene products&nbsp;is an opportunity for replacing low-ROI brands with market-relevant products, they believe. No wonder, even existing players are adding more products in the segment.  Companies and products Up for launch next is ITC&rsquo;s neem and glycerine soaps. It is expected to hit the stores in a month. ITC is already present in the premium soap category and sells under the brand -- Fiama Di Wills and Vivel.  In between, in mid-July, Tata Consumer joined the bandwagon. The company launched its germ-protection soap brand Skye in three variants -- anti-bacterial, menthol, and&nbsp;jojoba oil.  Dabur, an existing player, followed up by adding the Sanitize soap brand to its collection. Emami has already launched a&nbsp;Boroplus&nbsp;soap. ITC (Savlon), Reckitt Benckiser (Dettol), and Hindustan Unilever (Lifebuoy) are the major existing brands.  None of the companies are willing to talk as they are observing what is called a silent period ahead of the announcement of quarterly results. The Q2 results of these firms are due in a few weeks.  Although there is no data to verify how the soap category has fared during COVID-19 times, in the last interaction, after HUL&rsquo;s Q1 results, Chairman and Managing Director Sanjiv Mehta had told&nbsp;Moneycontrol&nbsp;that Lifebuoy products are the hot-sellers for the company.  The Indian soap industry According to Research and Markets, an online platform that provides market and research data from publishers, consultants, and analysts, the soap manufacturing industry is one of the biggest in the FMCG space in India, accounting for more than 50 percent of the consumer goods sector. Due to increasing awareness about hygiene standards, around 50 percent soaps are sold in the rural market.  How soap helps A study by WHO shows that just by washing hands properly with soap and water helps cut down stomach-related illnesses by 50 percent and respiratory infections by 16 percent.  In a blog on Unilever website, Sayandip Mukherjee, a virologist and Senior Research Scientist at Unilever R&amp;amp;amp;D, Bengaluru, explains: &ldquo;Some germs have an outer protective covering made up of two layers of fatty molecules. Soaps can help to break apart this outer protective layer, trapping and removing these germs along with any other oils and debris that are present in our hands. Now, for a soap to do all this, remember we must wash our hands for at least 20 seconds.&rdquo;","Business, Covid, Dabur, Emami, germ protection soap, HUL, ITC","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/himadri-buch-6865/', 'name': 'Himadri Buch'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/covid-19-impact-germ-protection-market-gets-crowdeditÃ¢ÂÂs-not-all-about-minting-money_14370141.html

Remdesivir had received regulatory approvals or temporary authorisations to treat COVID-19 in approximately 50 countries including India. The drug has been pre-qualified by WHO.  The antiviral has found to have some benefit in three other randomised, controlled clinical trials. In one large controlled trial in the US, the drug was found to have shortened recovery time by about a third in severely ill, hospitalised adults with COVID-19, but of little to help those with milder cases.

An open label trial means that both the researchers and participants know which drug is being given to participants.  &amp;quot;We are aware that initial data from the World Health Organization&rsquo;s (WHO) Solidarity trial has been made public prior to publication in a peer-reviewed journal,&amp;quot; said Gilead in a statement.  &amp;quot;The emerging data appear inconsistent with more robust evidence from multiple randomized, controlled studies published in peer-reviewed journals validating the clinical benefit of Veklury (remdesivir),&amp;quot; the company said.  &amp;quot;We are concerned that the data from this open label global trial have not undergone the rigorous review required to allow for constructive scientific discussion, particularly given the limitations of the trial design,&amp;quot; Gilead added.  Remdesivir, was originally developed as a treatment for Ebola. The drug was granted emergency use authorisation by the USFDA in May following a trial by the National Institutes of Health, which found that remdesivir modestly reduced the time to recovery in severely ill patients.  Gilead has entered into licensing pact with several generic drug makers such as Cipla, Hetero, Dr Reddy's, Zydus Cadila, Jubilant Life Sciences, Syngene and Mylan to manufacture and distribute the drug in 127 countries including India. The drug found to be a major intervention for moderate to several COVID-19 hospitalised patients.  There is also growing demand from doctors to extend the administration of remdesivir to mild COVID-19 patients.","Business, Companies, coronavirus, Health","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/viswanath-pilla-6848/', 'name': 'Viswanath Pilla'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/who-solidarity-trial-finds-remdesivir-has-no-substantial-effectmortalitycovid-19-patients_14371401.html

The move is probably the most audacious one that Gupta has made in what is already a dramatic rise, from being an obscure commodities businessman to heading an ever-expanding global metals empire.  While his company hasn't disclosed the offer value, it added &amp;quot;there is no certainty that the discussions will lead to any agreement or transaction.&amp;quot;  LIBERTY Steel is a global steel and mining business with annual revenues of about $15 billion and has 30,000 employees in more than 200 locations in four continents.&nbsp;Apart from steel, Gupta's GFG Alliance also&nbsp;produces aluminium. The Alliance's unit Liberty Steel Group operates the steel business, which is spread across Europe, Asia, Australia and the US.  &amp;quot;LIBERTY Steel&rsquo;s current proposal is a non-binding indicative offer (NBIO), subject to certain assumptions about the business. The NBIO is supported by a number of financial institutions. Given the opportunity to proceed in the transaction process, LIBERTY Steel is open to intensify the dialogue with thyssenkrupp and would like to engage in further due diligence to present a potential binding offer,&amp;quot; the company said.  thyseenkrupp had earlier unsuccessfully tried to merge its steel business with Tata Steel's European operations.  In an earlier interaction with Moneycontrol, Gupta had repeated his offer to buy Tata Steel's Port Talbot facility in the UK. Three years ago, Gupta had nearly bought the unit, along with Tata's specialty steel business.  The dramatic rise has often brought comparisons with LN Mittal, the Chairman &amp;amp;amp; CEO of ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker. If Gupta manages to acquire thyssenkrupp, which is the second largest maker of the metal in Europe, the entrepreneur will close the gap with Mittal.  At present, it is not known if the German company is in talks with any other suitor. Though there are few businessmen in the steel sector at the moment who are as aggressive as Gupta in expanding operations, thyssenkrupp may attract investors because of its much admired product mix and clientele. The company makes 11 million tons of steel in Europe.",Business,"{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/sanjeev-gupta39s-liberty-steel-group-makes-non-binding-offer-for-thyseenkrupp39s-steel-business_14372841.html

The nod came after the Hyderabad-based company submitted a reworked application to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on October 13 with more information on phase 2 and 3 trials.  Developed by Moscow&rsquo;s Gamaleya Institute, the Russian Defence Ministry and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RIDF), Sputnik V is based on a modified human adenovirus as the vector which carries the SARS-CoV-2 virus protein.  Also read: Gamaleya Institute's chief defends pace of Russian vaccination, says public-use of Sputnik V ethical  Dr Reddy&rsquo;s trials will be a multi-centre and randomised controlled study on 1,500 volunteers and will include safety and immunogenicity study.  The same day, it was reported that Delhi-based Mankind Pharma had signed an agreement with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RIDF) for the distribution and sale of Sputnik V in India.  The companies are yet to officially confirm the development that will make 300 million doses of Sputnik V available for distribution in India.  Track this LIVE blog for all the latest updates on coronavirus pandemic &nbsp;Sputnik, named after the world&rsquo;s first satellite launched by the erstwhile Soviet Union, is now a top vaccine contender along with those of AstraZeneca-Serum Institute of India, Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila that are undergoing clinical trials. &amp;amp;nbsp;  In September, Dr Reddy&rsquo;s and RDIF, which is marketing the vaccine overseas, entered into a partnership to conduct trials for Sputnik V and its distribution in India. RDIF will supply 100 million doses to Dr Reddy&rsquo;s after getting regulatory approval in India.  In addition to Indian clinical trial data, the Russians will provide safety and immunogenicity study from the Russian phase 3 clinical trial as well.  Sputnik V is undergoing trials in Moscow with 40,000 participants. Last week, Phase 3 trials commenced in the UAE as well. The trial will take six months to complete.  Media reports say the two-dose vaccine is available for the public in Russia but may not be available in other countries at least till the first half of 2021.  On September 16, RDIF reached an agreement with Dr Reddy&rsquo;s to conduct clinical trials and distribute 100 million doses of vaccine in India.  The results of Sputnik&rsquo;s Phase 1 and 2 trials were published in The Lancet in early September and showed that the vaccine triggered a strong immune response.  The results of the two trials, conducted in June-July this year and involving 76 participants, showed 100 percent of participants developing antibodies to the new coronavirus with no serious side effects, news agency Reuters reported Lancet as saying.  Russia became the first country to give approval to the vaccine but came in for criticism for going ahead with Sputnik V without a large-scale trial.","Business, Companies, coronavirus, Health","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/viswanath-pilla-6848/', 'name': 'Viswanath Pilla'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/russia39s-covid-19-vaccine-sputnik-v-makes-headwayindia_14377161.html

If there is a need, further stimulus is an option I am open to,&rdquo;&nbsp;Sitharaman said at the launch of 15th&nbsp;Finance Commission Chairman NK Singh&rsquo;s autobiography.  &ldquo;We have only now started doing some sort of assessment (of the economy and budget numbers). We have had inputs now which are very different from July. Sometime, we will have to come out with a statement, whether I do it in public or Parliament is what we have to decide,&rdquo; she said.  The Finance Ministry has begun the exercise of preparing the 2021-22 Union Budget. The first part of the process is coming up with revised estimates for the current fiscal year, in this case FY21. It remains to be seen if the finance ministry would present fresh GDP numbers for the current year before the Union Budget for next year.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has projected a contraction of 9.5 percent in real GDP for FY21, while the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has forecast a contraction of 10.3 percent.  Speaking at the launch, Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani said India was perfectly placed to embrace cleaner sources of energy over the coming decades. Listing transformation of energy as one of his aims, he said: &ldquo;India is in the right space to move away from fossil fuels to renewable energy in the next few decades.&rdquo;  Ambani also said transformation of India into a digital society and transformation of the education system were some of the initiatives he was planning to undertake.

The brokerage sees 1.5 percent growth YoY in personal care, 4 percent in the home-care segment and 4 percent in the packaged food and refreshments segment (organic). &amp;quot;A price-increase led growth in the tea segment will be offset by weak sales of out-of-home consumption products.

In a media concall post Q2 results, Mehta said from a long-term perspective per capita consumption in rural areas is half than that of urban areas, hence, rural will continue to grow at a rate faster than urban.  In line with last three quarters, HUL in the second quarter of FY21 witnessed rural demand ahead of urban.  Giving a rationale behind rural outpacing urban, Mehta said rural has done well especially because of migration of lot of people from metropolitan cities to the rural areas and government incentives.  The migrant labour population employed in metropolitan areas belonging to states such as Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar, Jharkhand, and West Bengal were worst affected due to the lockdown as they were left stranded and insecure with very meagre savings, forcing them to go back to their home towns.  Generally, rural India contributes 40 percent of overall FMCG spends and has historically been growing around 3 to 5 percentage points faster on account of increasing affordability, availability, and demand.  On the rationale behind growth in rural demand, Mehta said, &ldquo;In urban areas people are gravitating towards large packs and making infrequent trips and in rural it&rsquo;s the reverse. In rural areas, people are buying small packs and making frequent trips to the store,&rdquo; Mehta said.  The FMCG major reported a profit of Rs 2,009 crore in the quarter ended September 2020, rising 8.7 percent compared to Rs 1,848 crore in the same period last year.  Revenue from operations increased 16.1 percent to Rs 11,442 crore in Q2FY21 compared to Rs 9,852 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal.  Underlying domestic consumer business sales (excluding the impact of business combinations) grew by 3 percent in the September quarter, the company said in its BSE filing.  Most in demand products  To a Moneycontrol query on which were the most sold products in the second quarter, Mehta said, &ldquo;Foods &amp;amp;amp; Refreshment excluding what we have acquired from GSK, which includes products like tea, Knorr soups, ketchups all that combine put together have done well.&amp;quot;  HUL sells soups under the brand Knorr, Ketchups under Kissan, and Tea under the brand Red Label, Brooke Bond, and Taj Mahal.  Foods and Refreshment segment registered a 83 percent y-o-y growth in revenue at Rs 3,379 crore with its EBIT rising 90 percent and margin expanding 60 bps y-o-y.  Beauty and personal care division reported a 0.2 percent y-o-y decline in revenue at Rs 4,535 crore, but its EBIT increased 1 percent with margin expansion of 40 bps y-o-y.  HUL showed a 1.6 percent y-o-y decline in Home Care segment revenue at Rs 3,318 crore, but EBIT increased 13.9 percent and margin rose 280 bps compared to the year-ago period.  The company's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) for the quarter at Rs 2,869 crore grew by 17 percent y-o-y and margin improved by 30 bps compared to the September quarter 2019.  Mehta pointed out that sales growth of out-of-home consumption products, such as ice creams, water, and food solutions fell 25 percent.  Discretionary products, which include skin care, colour, cosmetics, and deodorants, also saw sales growth dropping 25 percent in Q2.  Mehta&nbsp;believes that currently people are confined in their homes, once people start stepping out, the discretionary category would start performing.","1-India Family Mart, Business, Companies, earnings, Hindustan Unilever, India, stocks","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/himadri-buch-6865/', 'name': 'Himadri Buch'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/worst-is-behind-us-says-hul-chairman-sanjiv-mehta_14386901.html

Numbers will be released on October 21.  Net interest income (NII) growth is expected to be in single digit YoY with lower growth in assets under management (AUM).  &amp;quot;NII Growth is expected to be at 4 percent YoY in Q2FY21 on the account of lower AUM growth due to focus more being on collections rather than growth. AUM growth is expected to be at 4 percent YoY (2 percent QoQ). Profit growth is likely to be at -33 percent YoY due to high credit cost expected in Q2FY21,&amp;quot; Narnolia Financial Services said.  Credit cost will continue to remain elevated (up 250 bps YoY to 4.3 percent) on account of write-offs in consumer finance book, in line with management's guidance, Kotak Institutional Equities feels.  According to the brokerage, moderate AUM growth is expected to be an interplay of (1) strong revival in disbursements after August 15, (2) rundown of short-tenure consumer loans and (3) interest accruals on loans under moratorium, but decline in cost of funds will boost NIM by 40 bps YoY to 9.9 percent.  As of July 20, 2020, the company had consolidated liquidity buffer of Rs 20,590 crore and SLR investments of Rs 2,550 crore. This represents 19.2 percent of its total borrowing.  Find All Earnings Related News Here  &amp;quot;Given the environment, the company will continue to run high liquidity buffer, despite an impact on cost of funds in the short term,&amp;quot; Narnolia said.  Pre-provision operating profit growth is likely to be in the range of 10-20 percent with improving cost-to-income ratio YoY.  &amp;quot;The company is well focused on OPEX control with no incremental hiring till September 2020, frizzing advertisement and other discretionary expenses and no branch expansion till September 2020. So cost-to-income ratio is likely to improve going ahead 27 percent in Q2FY21,&amp;quot; said Narnolia which sees pre-provision operating profit growing 15 percent YoY.

HUVR results beat expectations driven by double digit growth in Health, Nutrition and Hygiene and better than expected recovery in Personal care. HUL remains confident of gaining market share across categories and has cut prices of Detergents and absorbed part of input cost increase in Tea. Although color cosmetics and Deo&rsquo;s will see a delayed recovery, lack of inventory push will enable strong 3Q relative to last year. GSK integration is in progress and any meaningful gains in sales growth will accrue from 4Q only. Near term margin outlook remains challenging given higher prices of Palmoil and Tea and bottomed out ad- spends. We remain structurally positive on HUL given its strategy around emerging categories, increasing distribution, WIMI, digital market and strength in Supply chain. We estimate HUL to post EBIDTA CAGR of 15.9% over FY20-23 led by 200bps margin expansion. Outlook We however cut EPS estimates by 2-4% as we increase dividend payout to 95% and assume lower interest on surplus funds.

The company is seeing (a) ad-spends inching up (-5% YoY; ahead of expectations), (b) sharp increase in palm oil costs, and (c) mix deterioration. Thus, HUVR did well in growing its EBITDA margins (including GSKCH) by 30bp YoY and restricting like-for-like margin decline to only 60bp YoY. Margin outlook for HUVR has also improved as share of its discretionary portfolio to total sales should increase sequentially. Outlook for the company is gradually improving. The discretionary part of its portfolio (15% of sales) is seeing gradual recovery. In a period of relative normalcy, we believe that HUVR (as has been the case in recent years) is likely to post superior earnings growth, leading us to maintain Buy rating. Outlook We remain positive on HUVR from a medium-term perspective encouraged by: (a) robust earnings growth potential beyond the near term owing to its portfolio and execution strengths, and (b) significant synergies in FY22E as a result of GSKCH. These factors suggest premium multiples are likely to sustain. Valuing the company at 55x Sep&rsquo;22E merged EPS, we arrive at a TP of INR2,620, implying a 21% upside.

These are likely to drive the strongest topline growth since FY12 (15.2% in FY21E) and the highest PAT growth since FY16 (35.2% in FY21E). Sales momentum is tapering after an extraordinary spurt of ~27% in 1QFY21.

UVG was at +1% (HSIE -2%). Home Care remained weak at 2% YoY decline as demand for fabric wash was sluggish (also impacted by price cuts). BPC recovered well but was flat after a sharp 12% YoY decline in 1QFY21. F&amp;amp;amp;R clocked strong growth of 19% (ex-GSK), aided by in-home consumption. The company clocked double-digit growth in 80% of its portfolio, which indicates a strong recovery. GM contracted by 145bps YoY due to commodity inflation and adverse product mix. ASP saw a sequential increase as the company resumed investments. We expect a gradual recovery in core categories in 2HFY21. We maintain our below-consensus EPS estimate for FY21/FY22/FY23. Outlook We roll forward our target price to Sep-22E EPS and value HUL at 50x P/E to derive a TP of Rs 2,060. Maintain REDUCE on a muted absolute growth trajectory and limited scope for re-rating.

The company could see a decline in profitability but operating earnings may&nbsp;remain strong on a year-on-year basis due to cost measures, with revenue growth at 2-3 percent.  On the sequential basis (i.e. compared to June quarter 2020), earnings may see a substantial increase due to low base in Q1 FY21 that affected by lockdown.  &amp;quot;We expect a recovery in decorative paints volumes in September 2020 quarter (down 35-45 percent YoY in June 2020) and following trends: (1) growth driven by North and East followed by South; West would be a bit soft, dragged down by Maharashtra, (2) tier-2 and tier-3 towns would continue to drive growth, (3) volume growth would continue to be 500-600 bps higher than value growth on account of higher sales of economy products and putty,&amp;quot; said Kotak Institutional Equities which sees 3 percent fall in profit but 2 percent increase in revenue and 17 percent rise in EBITDA in Q2FY21 YoY.  For Asian Paints, the brokerage estimates 2.7 percent YoY growth in domestic decorative sales (standalone) led by about 8 percent volume growth, and expect flat sales in overseas business (subsidiaries) led by a recovery in Indonesia and MENA regions.  Gross margin expansion could be 230 bps YoY and 80 bps sequentially due to a fall in crude oil prices, said Motilal Oswal which sees 3 percent revenue growth YoY and 17.5 percent growth in EBITDA. Sharekhan too sees 3 percent growth in Q2 revenue YoY.  The price of titanium dioxide (TiO2), a crude-linked raw material, was down 4.2 percent in Q2FY21 YoY.  &amp;quot;Continued cost-saving initiatives and slightly lower media intensity would translate into robust EBITDA margin expansion,&amp;quot; Kotak said.  According to the brokerage house, the sequential increase in profit could be 220 percent, revenue 76 percent and EBITDA 131 percent with 520 bps margin expansion in September quarter 2020.

The showcause notice levelled allegation that the compliance officer, Rohit Krishan Puri, and Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal, by giving pre-clearance to trades to Vittal during the UPSI period violated the provisions of code of conduct under PIT regulations.  However, Sebi concluded that the information regarding the proposed acquisition was a publicly available information and the same cannot be treated as UPSI. The information had actually become public first on July 7, 2017, and thereafter it continued to remain in circulation in public domain. Further, the application for pre-clearance of the trade was made on August 7, 2017, which was well after the UPSI period i.e. June 3, 2017, to July 7, 2017.  &amp;quot;The trade done by the Noticees 1 and 2 on August 10, 2017, do not fall under the UPSI period,&amp;quot; Sebi said. Noticee 1 and 2 refer to Gopal Vittal and Bharti Telecom, respectively.  Vittal, being in possession of UPSI, which is a positive development, should have been holding the shares and sell the same subsequent to publication of the said information. However, he sold the share much before the alleged UPSI was made public by the company, Sebi said. It added that therefore, the trading pattern of Gopal Vittal at the time of selling of shares to Bharti Telecom does not confirm with the UPSI, as he does not seem to have made any kind of profit or avoided any loss out of the sale of shares.  The continuous acquisition of shares of Bharti Airtel by Bharti Telecom in the past three years and no corresponding sale of shares subsequent to the publication of the price-sensitive information, do not fit in the trading pattern of an entity that would try to gain benefit out of an UPSI, it added. Regarding Rohit Krishan Puri, Sebi noted that the pre-clearance was sought from him by Vittal along with the declaration that he was not in possession of UPSI.  As an additional measure of caution, Puri also discussed the same with Sunil Bharti Mittal before granting pre-clearance. Sebi noted that &amp;quot;enough precautions&amp;quot; had been taken by him.  &amp;quot;Further, it is seen that no responsibility is mentioned of the chairman of a company under&hellip;model code of conduct. Therefore, Noticee 4 cannot be held liable for the violation &hellip; of model code of conduct,&amp;quot; Sebi said regarding Sunil Bharti Mittal. Therefore, Sebi disposed of the charges leveled against Bharti Telecom, Sunil Bharti Mittal, Gopal Vittal and Rohit Krishan Puri.","Bharti Airtel, Bharti Telecom, Business, Market news, SEBI, Sunil Bharti Mittal","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/sebi-disposesproceedings-against-bharti-telecom-sunil-bharti-mittal-two-others_14395941.html

The company is expected to post a fall in EBITDA margin and profit after tax (PAT) on a yearly basis.  As per the estimates of brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services, Tech Mahindra's revenue may inch up by 1.7 percent year-on-year (YoY) but PAT may fall 21.8 percent YoY.  While EBITDA margin may improve quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), on a yearly basis, it may be down.  &amp;quot;Q2 FY21 EBITDA margin may come at 15.5 percent, up from 14.3 percent in Q1 FY21 but down from 16.5 percent in Q2 FY20,&amp;quot; Motilal Oswal said.  On similar lines, Kotak Institutional Equities expects a 2 percent YoY rise in Tech Mahindra's revenue but adjusted PAT may see a 14.6 percent YoY fall. EBITDA margin may slip 45 bps YoY.  &amp;quot;We forecast constant currency (CC) revenue growth of 1.8 percent QoQ. Revenue growth will be led by&mdash;(1) sharp growth in BPO business led by easing of supply-side constraints, (2) stabilisation in manufacturing and growth in financial services and healthcare, (3) BPO-led growth in communications practice,&amp;quot; Kotak said.  Kotak expects net-new TCV to range from $400-500 million. The normalisation of deal wins is largely on the back of decisions on mid-sized deals, Kotak said.  As per the brokerage, capital allocation policy will be an area of focus along with measures taken by the company to improve operating margins and sustainable operating band.  Centrum Institutional Research expects Tech Mahindra to deliver constant currency revenue growth of 1.6 percent QoQ.  &amp;quot;Cross-currency would be tailwind of 140bps for the quarter. Hence, reported USD revenues would grow by 3 percent QoQ. We expect EBIT margins for Q2 FY21 at 11.4 percent, up 135bps QoQ,&amp;quot; Centrum said.  While Tech Mahindra has shown strong margin performance in Q1 FY21, Centrum believes the company may show this continued margin expansion in Q2 FY21 as well.

Despite 7% YoY fall in revenue, EBITDA remained flat at Rs 12.66bn with margin of 17.7% (+110bps YoY) owing to sharp improvement in domestic 2W business margin (higher share of Pulsar 125 and ultra-premium segment and better FX realization). APAT declined 18% YoY due to lower other income. The management expects volume recovery momentum to continue in 2HFY21, aided by increasing preference for personal mobility, ramp up in export volume and pick up in domestic festival season sales.

The company, which exports to around 79 countries globally, reported its best ever dispatches to international markets last month.  &amp;quot;In terms of recovery, international business is doing better than domestic because most of the countries where we export have not been impacted that much by the pandemic and lockdowns as India,&amp;quot; Bajaj Auto CFO Soumen Ray told PTI in an interview.  The demand is very robust and various markets like Africa, Latin America Middle East and South Asia are doing very well, he added.  &amp;quot;We have only two areas of concern, one is ASEAN region where major markets like the Philippines and Cambodia are witnessing lockdowns and restrictions. Other is Sri Lanka,&nbsp;where the government has banned import of vehicles,&amp;quot; Ray said.  Barring these two, the company is witnessing very strong revival, he added.  &amp;quot;It (revival in export markets) is borne out of two factors -- severity of pandemic has been less in these regions and thus, the economy is also less impacted,&amp;quot; Ray said.  The company''s export order book is very strong for the next few months, he said.  Bajaj Auto shipped 2.12 lakh units in September to various international markets.  In July-September period, however, two-wheeler dispatches fell 11 per cent to 4,14,271 units as compared with 4,62,890 units in the same period of previous fiscal.  Commenting on the outlook for domestic market, Ray said the company is witnessing increase in footfalls and inquiries at the dealerships.  &amp;quot;Jury is still out regarding the festive season this year. Looking at the response in the first few days of the festive season, our sense is that it is going to be similar or marginally better than last year,&amp;quot; he noted.  On three-wheeler sales, Ray said the revival in the segment depends on pick up in economic activity involving small commercial vehicles.  &amp;quot;Certain economic activity is required for demand to come back. Economic activity here pertains to movement of people from one place to another, relatively short distances, in both urban and rural landscapes,&amp;quot; he noted.  &amp;quot;Till that doesn''t happen, like opening of schools, entertainment areas, why would anybody like to buy a commercial two-wheeler or a three-wheeler,&amp;quot; he added.  He, however, said that situation is improving in the three-wheeler segment and September quarter was much better than first quarter of the current fiscal.","Auto, Business, Companies","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/export-markets-leading-sales-revival-bajaj-auto_14402601.html

","ICICI Direct's research report on Asian Paints Asian Paints reported stellar numbers with one of the best quarterly EBITDA margins in Q2FY21. The EBITDA margin at 23.6%, up ~470 bps YoY led by benign raw material prices and saving in other expenditure in Q2FY21. On the revenue front, sales growth at ~6% YoY was led by double digit (I-direct estimate: ~10%) volume growth in Q2FY21. Despite being a lean season on account of monsoons, the strong decorative volume growth is attributable to significant pent up demand in rural and semi urban regions led by repainting/maintenance activities. Gradual opening up of metro regions along with inventory build-up in the wake of festive seasons at dealer would have also help drive the volume growth in Q2FY21. We believe normalisation in metro regions, revival in the real estate industry and intact repainting demand from semi-urban, rural India would drive paint demand, going forward. Besides, we believe favourable raw material prices are likely to keep gross margins elevated in the coming quarters even with a change in product mix. This, coupled with rationalisation of other costs would help drive EBITDA margin, going forward. We revise our revenue, earnings estimates upside by 6% and 33%, respectively, for FY21E factoring in the current quarter performance.

Founder&nbsp;and chief executive Uday Kotak has held initial talks with the promoters of IndusInd, in which the Hinduja family could retain a stake in the merged entity after a deal, Bloomberg reported on October 25.  The country's third-largest private lender by market capitalisation&nbsp;is looking to take over its smaller counterpart, and boost its assets by around 83 percent, the report said. Meanwhile, the deal could save IndusInd bank after its market value has tanked 60 percent in 2020.

The growth in net interest income could also slow down to around 12 percent year-on-year with moderate loan growth and a slight contraction in net interest margin for the quarter ended September 2020.  The pre-provision in operating profit (PPoP) growth is also expected to moderate to little over 10 percent YoY due to slow growth in net interest income and other income, supported by controlled operating expenses.  &amp;quot;We expect net interest margin to dip, on account of asset side re-pricing and a lower cost-to-deposit ratio. NIMs will be partially cushioned by the recent drop in saving account rates and the recent fundraise. We expect NII growth of 12.6 percent YoY (up 1 percent QoQ),&amp;quot; said HDFC Securities.  &amp;quot;With controlled operating expenses growth PPoP is expected to grow at 10.5 percent YoY and 5.6 percent QoQ.

A cloud-based omni-channel communications platform, Airtel IQ, aims to enable brands to deepen engagement with customers through timely and secure communication, a company statement said, terming the move as a &amp;quot;game changer&amp;quot; for the fast-evolving Indian enterprise communication segment.  The Indian cloud communications market, estimated at USD 1 billion, is seen growing nearly 20 per cent annually.  Airtel IQ aims to eliminate the need for multiple communication platforms for different channels, and already companies including Swiggy, Justdial, Urban Company, Havells, Dr. Lal Path Labs and Rapido have signed up as customers for Airtel IQ in the beta phase.  The platform, now commercially available, runs on a pay-as-you-go model meaning that the costs for enterprises would depend on the consumption levels.  &amp;quot;With just a slice of code, businesses can embed communication services such as voice, SMS, IVR (interactive voice response) in their applications and digital properties across desktop and mobile, all through a unified platform,&amp;quot; the statement said.  Ajay Chitkara, Director and CEO &ndash; Airtel Business said that the new platform could translate into 30-40 per cent cost reduction for enterprises as compared to traditional models.  Airtel expects large call centre ecosystem, e-commerce and internet companies, start-ups, banks and those into manufacturing and distribution to be early adopters of the platform, given their need for omni-channel communications.  Citing an example, Airtel said, for a customer ordering food through an online platform and calling the delivery agent to find out the status of her order, the entire communication is conducted seamlessly and securely over Airtel IQ. The communication is encrypted and all mobile/telephone numbers are masked.  Airtel IQ has been fully developed by Airtel''s in-house engineering teams.  &amp;quot;Natively integrated into telco grade infrastructure and architected by top digital talent, Airtel IQ is robust, secure, cost-efficient and intuitive,&amp;quot; the Airtel statement said.  Airtel is a large player in the business-to-business connectivity space and serves over one million businesses with a portfolio that spans connectivity, cloud, security and collaboration and data centre solutions.  Adarsh Nair, Chief Product Officer, Bharti Airtel, said &amp;quot;Airtel IQ is first amongst several game changing products that we will be bringing to the market&rdquo;.

PAT for BALIC grew 13% YoY even as gross written premium degrew 3% YoY on account of cost saving, some of them structural. PAT for BAGIC fell 53% Y-o-Y to INR 977 Mn on account of higher new business strain and lower capital gains even as there are structural savings in costs.

Rise in pre-provision operating profit, NII and other income also boosted profitability.  Net interest income - the difference between interest earned and interest expended - increased 16.8 percent to Rs&nbsp;3,913.2 crore in July-September quarter 2020 compared to corresponding period previous fiscal.  Loan book declined 4 percent year-on-year to Rs 2.04 lakh crore and net interest margin contracted to 4.52 percent from 4.61 percent YoY, Kotak&nbsp;Mahindra Bank said, adding deposits at Rs 2.61 lakh crore grew by 12.2 percent YoY.  Provisions and contingencies fell 9.6 percent to Rs 368.59 crore compared to year-ago period, while the sequential fall was 61.7 percent.  Provisions included general provision for COVID-19 deferment cases (Rs 13 crore in Q2FY21 against Rs 616 crore in Q1FY21) and provision towards advances as well as others (Rs 332.72 crore against Rs 352.88 crore QoQ), the bank said in its BSE filing.  COVID-19 related provisions as at September 2020 stood at Rs 1,279 crore (0.62 percent of net advances). Non-specific provisions towards advances (including standard and COVID provisions) is at 177 percent of the net NPA of the bank,&amp;quot; it added.  On the asset quality front, gross non-performing assets as a percentage of gross advances fell 15 bps quarter-on-quarter to 2.55 percent in the quarter ended September 2020, and net NPA was down 23 bps QoQ to 0.64 percent, partly due to Supreme Court's interim order which directed on September 3 that accounts which were not declared as NPA till August 31, 2020 shall not be declared as NPA till further orders.  Hence, the bank said it had not classified any account (whether granted moratorium or not) as NPA after August 31.  &amp;quot;If the said Order was not given effect to, the gross NPA would have been 2.70 percent and net NPA 0.74 percent. The Bank has, however, made provision for such advances,&amp;quot; it added.  Pre-provision operating profit has seen sharp spike of 31.4 percent to Rs 3,297.49 crore in Q2FY21, compared to corresponding period last fiscal. Non-interest income increased 18.6 percent YoY to Rs 1,452.03 crore in September quarter.  Consolidated profit for the Q2FY21 increased by 22 percent to Rs 2,947 crore, including bank's contribution at Rs 2,184 crore.  Kotak Securities reported a 33.6 percent YoY growth in Q2 profit at Rs 199 crore and Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance 18.8 percent rise at Rs 171 crore, but Kotak Mahindra Prime's profit fell 22.7 percent to Rs 133 crore in September quarter YoY.  LIC increased its stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank to 3.18 percent at the end of September quarter, compared to 2.45 percent in June quarter.  Overall the asset quality concerns weighed on the banking sector. Hence the stock has not seen any major movement during the September quarter and financial year 2020-21, falling 6.8 percent and rising 6.7 percent respectively, though it gained 26 percent from March lows.

Packaged food category has done well, and Nestle&rsquo;s performance in the past two quarters was steady (6.5% YoY growth). Maggi, Kitkat and Nescafe (in-home consumption) posted double-digit growth. Exports also bounced back with 9% YoY growth. GM expansion was slower at 54bps YoY (58.1%). Cost control initiatives led to EBITDA growth of 16.5% (HSIE 16%). We expect Nestle&rsquo;s recovery to be steady, and we maintain our EBITDA estimates. As the increase in Capex has resulted in lower other income, we cut our EPS estimate for CY21/CY22 by 3/3%. Outlook The stock is trading at 60x P/E on CY21 EPS and limits absolute upside in the medium term, making the risk-reward unattractive.

USD revenue was up 2.9% QoQ CC vs. TCS/INFY/WIPRO/HCLT performance of +4.8/+4.0/+2.0/+4.5% QoQ CC respectively. Telecom was up 3.2% QoQ (in line with our estimate), but Enterprise (+6.0% QoQ) performed better than expected. Growth was led by Technology &amp;amp;amp; Media (+14.1% QoQ), BFSI and Retail bounced back strongly, while manufacturing was stable. BPM recovered strongly (+31.1% QoQ) due to market share gains and reversal in supply-side factors. Net-new TCV improved to USD 421mn, and the pipeline continues to remain strong. The 5G related spend has shifted to FY22E, but TechM is well-poised to benefit from this spend. Telecom recovery will be gradual (led by 5G), but Enterprise will drive growth, supported by a revival in Manufacturing and Retail verticals. Margin expansion of +413bps QoQ was better than expected (14.2% vs. the estimate of 11.3%), led by offshoring, higher utilisation, lower sub-con and visa fees. Outlook TechM aims to expand the margin to 15%, but it will still have the lowest margin in Tier-1 IT. We increase our EPS estimate by 7.1/8.1% for FY22/23E to factor in better growth and margin. Our target price stands at Rs 940, based on 16x (~15% premium to 5Y average) Sep-22E EPS. The stock currently trades at a P/E of 17.0/15.2x FY21/22E.

393,2020-10-26 21:32:40+05:30,Reliance Industries Ltd.,RELIANCE,"BP eyes India's fuel market, wants gas in GST: CEO Bernard Looney","On the impact of COVID-19 on oil demand, Looney said it was too early to say what the true impact was but there would be some impact in the medium to long term. ","Labelling India as an extraordinary country growing at an incredible scale, energy supermajor BP Plc on&nbsp;October 26 said it is looking to expand its presence in the nation in fuel retailing and mobility solutions, but wanted natural gas to be included in the GST regime. Speaking at the India Energy Forum by CERAWeek, BP Group chief executive Bernard Looney said his firm in partnership with Reliance Industries Ltd will in the next 4-5 years set up 5,500 retail sites that will not just sell petrol and diesel but also offer mobility solutions like EV charging facility.  &amp;quot;India is an extraordinary country with an extraordinary history, an extraordinary group of people, and with extraordinary ambition,&amp;quot; he said, adding the country has a growing population, and an ambitious agenda to cut emissions. This, he said, was &amp;quot;very, very compelling&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;Why is India important, because it is India,&amp;quot; he said, adding energy mix in the country could fall from 50 percent coal to 40 percent, while gas and renewables will grow. Looney said India will be the fastest-growing fuel and lubricant market in the next 20 years and his group's venture with Reliance will grow the network of petrol pumps to 5,500 in the next 4-5 years from the current 1,400.  As many as 80,000 jobs will be created in the building of the network, he said, adding the venture will offer mobility solutions under the Jio-BP brand. RIL, currently, has about 1,400 operating petrol pumps and some 31-odd aviation fuel stations at airports. These have been taken over by the RIL-BP joint venture and will be grown in the future. While petrol pumps will be expanded to 5,500, aviation refuelling facilities will grow to 45. RIL, currently, has about 1,400 operating petrol pumps and some 31-odd aviation fuel stations at airports.  RIL holds 51 percent in the new joint venture company, while BP has the remaining 49 percent. BP paid about Rs 7,000 crore to acquire the 49 percent stake. This is the third joint venture between Reliance and BP since 2011.  BP had in 2011 bought a 30 percent stake in 21 oil and gas exploration and production blocks of Reliance for $7.2 billion. At that time, another 50:50 joint venture, India Gas Solutions, was set up for sourcing and marketing gas in India. RIL-BP is investing $5 billion in developing the next set of discoveries in the KG Basin D6 block.  &amp;quot;Our production with Reliance will account for 15 percent of India gas production,&amp;quot; he said. Looney said while the company feels the ease of doing business on the ground, India is a complex market.  GST was a welcome federal initiative to ease trade and it will be good if natural gas is included in that. When Goods and Services Tax (GST), which amalgamated 17 different central and state levies like excise duty and VAT, was implemented in July 2017, five products &ndash; petrol, diesel, crude oil, aviation turbine fuel, and natural gas, were kept out of its purview for the time being.  This meant that gas users could not set off tax paid on inputs against those on the final product and tax on tax continued, disincentivising the use of the fuel. He said BP has a &amp;quot;deep, trusting relationship&amp;quot; with Mukesh Ambani, chairman of RIL.  On the impact of COVID-19 on oil demand, he said it was too early to say what the true impact was but there would be some impact in the medium to long term. But communities around the world are demanding more affordable, reliable, and clean energy and BP was committed to providing solutions for the same, he said.  Speaking at the same event, Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said India is one of the largest markets in the world for energy, but its per capita consumption is just 30 percent of the world average, offering huge potential. &amp;quot;We want to be an important part of India,&amp;quot; he said, adding the French group is investing in setting up LNG import terminal, city gas expansion, and renewable energy projects in the country.

Emkay Global expects Bharti Airtel's net sales to see a 17 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth while EBITDA and EBITDA margin may rise 21.9 percent and 177 bps YoY, respectively, due to coronavirus-related cost-saving in SG&amp;amp;amp;A coming back in the base.  The company's India wireless revenues shall rise sequentially, boosted by a 43 lakh increase in data subscribers against the stable data subs in the last quarter, the brokerage said.  Emkay expects ARPU to rise 1 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) despite a seasonally weak quarter, accompanied by the return of some voice subscribers in the base.  &amp;quot;Data volume shall continue to accrue benefits of the lockdown and rise 7.5 percent QoQ, while MOU shall see a decline due to seasonality,&amp;quot; Emkay said.  The Africa business, as per Emkay Global, should witness a 3 percent sequential revenue rise on the back of a low base due to currency devaluation.  Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects Airtel's ARPU to largely remain flat. It foresees a 4 percent subscriber growth in home broadband and 3 percent revenue growth in enterprise business.  As per Motilal's estimates, the company's adjusted PAT for Q2FY21 may come at Rs 300 crore against a loss of Rs 1,100 crore in Q2FY20. Revenue may see a 16 percent YoY jump.  Brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities expects a 15.1 percent YoY jump in the company's net sales.  Kotak said as offline recharge activity is likely to have improved (after the COVID-led disruption in the previous quarter), it expects reported subs to be higher by 29 lakh QoQ.  &amp;quot;We build in a 1.2 percent QoQ (up 21.5 percent YoY) increase in implied ARPU,&amp;quot; Kotak said.  For the Africa business, Kotak expects a flat quarter sequentially (up 8.6 percent YoY) on a reported basis.  &amp;quot;Among the other businesses, we expect 4 percent QoQ growth in revenues for the home broadband, 3 percent QoQ growth for the enterprise business, and 2 percent QoQ growth in the DTH business,&amp;quot; Kotak said.

Strong growth in pricing, especially in Sep, has resulted in upgrades to our FY21 estimates. However, we believe a large part of the price hikes is done and do not expect prices to improve sharply now. The strong price hike in Q2 was driven by shortage of steel in the trade segment. With some mills taking partial shutdowns, auto sheet deliveries ramping up improvement in infra demand and continued exports, trade segment was under-served, leading to price hikes. In our view, the BPSL acquisition will continue to be EPS dilutive for the next few years till further investments are made to increase capacity of the plant to 4mt from 2.6mt. In the near term, captive iron ore cost will likely restrict EBITDA expansion due to price hikes.  Outlook We raise FY21 EBITDA estimate by 29% but leave FY22E largely unchanged. We believe strong cash flows will result in higher capex as JSW completes pending projects. High leverage with impending BPSL acquisition remains our key concern. Maintain Sell with a revised TP of Rs256 (up from Rs161), driven by higher multiple (6.5x vs. 5.5x earlier) as steel remains strong but substantial price hikes are now difficult.

Domestic business grew 10%, beating estimates by 3%, with strong performance from noodles, coffee and chocolates, benefitting from in-home consumption. EBITDA was largely in line with growth of 16%. PAT was flat due to lower ETR in the base. Gross margins expanded 180bps qoq, led by low milk prices, which are likely to sustain in the near term. Softer commodity prices and control on other overheads are likely to help maintain a positive margin outlook. Growth outlook has improved (vs. Q1), with a ramp-up in the supply chain and continued benefits from high in-home consumption. Growth in the core portfolio remains strong.

On a standalone basis, the company reported sales volume of 4.12 million tonnes (MT) (vs. our estimate of 4.0 MT). As domestic steel demand rebounded from recent lows and gained momentum, JSW Steel reduced the share of exports in its overall volume-mix. In Q2FY21, exports as a percentage of total sales fell to 28% vs. 57% in Q1FY21. Consolidated topline came in at Rs 19264 crore (up 13% YoY, 64% QoQ), higher than our estimate of Rs 18331 crore. Topline came in higher than our estimate on the back of better-than-expected realisations. Consolidated EBITDA came in at Rs 4414 crore (up 95% YoY, 229% QoQ), higher than our estimate of Rs 3525 crore. Consolidated EBITDA margin came in at 22.9% (up 1150 bps QoQ, 970 bps YoY), higher than our estimate of 19.2%. Healthy EBITDA margins were on account of lower price of imported coal, better operating leverage and savings in procurement costs, fixed overheads. However, this benefit was partially offset by increase in iron ore prices. Ensuing consolidated PAT for Q2FY21 was at Rs 1595 crore, higher than our estimate of Rs 1085 crore.  Outlook JSW Steel&rsquo;s blended realisations increased ~11%, thereby aiding healthy performance for the quarter. On the back of strength in steel prices, we expect the good performance to continue. Going forward, we model EBITDA margin of 19.4% for FY21E and 20.2% for FY22E. We value the stock on an SoTP basis, thereby arriving at a target price of Rs 330. We have a HOLD rating on the stock.

403,2020-10-27 13:43:59+05:30,JSW Steel Ltd.,JSWSTEEL,Why JSW Steel's Seshagiri Rao believes analysts are missing the woods for the trees,"Though the company stock fell, despite beating estimates in Q2, its Jt MD and CFO points out trends in demand, prices, and JSW Steel's expansion path, to explain why he is optimistic about the remaining two quarters. ","An estimate-beating performance&nbsp;is usually welcomed by a thumbs up from the Street. Instead, when markets opened on Monday morning, JSW Steel's stock slipped by 4 percent. The response&nbsp;must have been disappointing as on October 23, the steel major has announced a net profit of&nbsp; Rs 1,593 crore, as against one of the estimates that had expected the bottom line at Rs 1,005 crore.  The recovery in its earning was striking as in the first quarter, JSW Steel had suffered a loss of Rs 582 crore, laid low by the COVID-19 disruption.  The stock&nbsp;fall was not all.&nbsp;Credit Suisse downgraded the stock to neutral from outperform, even as it raised the target.  Seshagiri Rao, JSW Steel's Joint Managing Director and CFO refused to judge if the brokerages were right or wrong. Or, if the street was being hard on the company's stock.  Perhaps, the brokerages have already factored in the gains of the second quarter, not to mention that the steelmaker's stock has already hit a 52-week high. Its stock had outperformed peers by a mile. The upside, the brokerages thus deem, could be limited in the remaining two quarters of the year.  But are the Street and the brokerages missing the woods for the trees?  In a detailed conversation with Moneycontrol, as Rao explained why JSW Steel is in a better position than its peers to make the most of the larger rebound in the economy in the coming quarters, it sure felt that the industry veteran was more sanguine than the street.  Rao's optimism is based on two main pillars.  Better steel demand and stable prices  One, he expects steel demand in the third and fourth quarters of the current financial year to better the levels seen in the second.  &amp;quot;I will be cautious. In the first two quarters, we lost 5 million tons of steel consumption as economic activity, initially came to a standstill and then made a recovery,&amp;quot; says Rao. &amp;quot;In the third quarter, the demand will be normal, and we won't lose,&amp;quot; he adds.  The trend is visible in its production numbers.&nbsp;The company's standalone production volumes stood at 3.85 million tonnes for the second quarter, as against 2.96 million tonnes in the June quarter. A year ago, it produced 3.84 million tonnes in the September quarter.  The fourth quarter, says Rao, demand will grow, year-on-year. And that is because of the base year effect, as in March 2020, the industry lost nearly a fortnight of sales as COVID-19 set in and the government announced the lockdown. So the fourth quarter ending March 31, 2021, will benefit.  Rao's outlook on the demand hinges on the auto sector continuing its recovery&nbsp; - JSW Steel sold 33 percent more automotive steel in Q2, YoY - and on the rural markets, backed by better monsoon and bumper harvest.  On steel prices, the senior executive admits that the rates in the second half of the year, may not increase by a similar 18 percent seen in the first six months. But the prices, won't fall, says Rao.  The belief is based on the unrelenting appetite of China, which produced 34 million tons more in the nine months, till September. It continues to import. The trend, says Rao, will continue.  While demand in the rest of the world market has fallen, so has production. Of the 132 blast furnaces that were shut globally following the pandemic, only 25 have re-opened till now.  &amp;quot;Production and demand are going in the same direction,&amp;quot; says Rao, signalling a stable price scenario.  Benefit of scale  With demand improving and prices remaining stable, the conditions may be conducive for JSW Steel as it expands capacity at its facility in Dolvi, Maharashtra.  Though the expansion has been delayed by six months, the doubling of capacity to 10 million tons, will take JSW Steel's overall volume to 23 million tons a year. &amp;quot;No other major capacity addition is coming online,&amp;quot; points out Rao. The expansion will be completed by March 2020.  More importantly, 80 percent of the expansion in downstream facilities&nbsp; - from 5 million tons to 9 million tons a year - will be completed by March. This will increase the share of value-added and specialised products in the overall product portfolio pie to 39 percent. This will improve the company's margins, says Rao.  The scaling up of production at iron ore mines will also help. &amp;quot;We have started production at eight of the nine mines in Karnataka. The remaining one will begin production this quarter,&amp;quot; said Rao. This will provide the company with 7 million tons of the key raw material. The rest, of the total requirement of 22 million tons, will be procured from the market.  While in Odisha it has started operating four mines that it got through auction, JSW Steel won't yet ship the ore from the state to its unit in Karnataka because of high logistics cost. That will have to wait for a slurry pipelines and conveyors.  The company's units in Dolvi and Salem are already self-sufficient in iron ore needs.  In another sign that the important factors have recovered and expected to do better, JSW Steel has brought back bonuses and variable component payments for its employees. These were deferred earlier.  &amp;quot;No (brokerage) reports reflect these,&amp;quot; says Rao, on the reasons that underline his optimism.","Business, Companies, Covid-19, JSW Steel","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/prince-mathews-thomas-7633/', 'name': 'Prince Mathews Thomas'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/why-jsw-steel39s-seshagiri-rao-believes-analystsmissingwoods-fortrees_14415101.html

The company's consolidated profit declined to Rs 762 crore from Rs 1,092.5 crore in the year-ago period but increased 32 percent sequentially. The YoY decline was higher than CNBC-TV18 poll estimate of Rs 646 crore.  The company had a tax credit of Rs 326.1 crore in year-ago period. The effective tax rate was around 11.6 percent (Rs 99.8 crore tax expenses) for the quarter, which was lower primarily due to recognition of deferred tax assets for one of subsidiaries, said company.  Consolidated revenue during the quarter increased 2 percent to Rs 4,896.7 crore YoY as there was proprietary products out-licensing income in Q2FY20, and the same grew by 11 percent QoQ.  The Q2FY21 YoY revenue growth stood at 20 percent after adjusted for proprietary products out-licensing income in the previous year, the company said in its BSE filing.  &amp;quot;We are pleased to report continued growth across all the markets and improved productivity which is reflected in the healthy EBITDA margin and RoCE,&amp;quot; Co-chairman &amp;amp;amp; MD G V Prasad said.  The global generics business registered a 21 percent YoY growth, with North America rising 28 percent, Europe 36 percent and India 21 percent in the quarter ended September 2020.  &amp;quot;The growth in global generics business was driven primarily on account of new product launches, volume traction in the base business and integration of the acquired business from Wockhardt in India,&amp;quot; said Dr Reddy's.  The company launched nine new products in North America including Ciprofloxacin and Dexamethasone Otic suspension, Fulvestrant injection, OTC Diclofenac and OTC Olapatadine.  It filed two new ANDAs in the quarter. As of September 2020, &amp;quot;cumulatively 94 generic filings are pending for approval with the USFDA&amp;quot;, the company said.  India business grew primarily on account of revenues from the acquired business of Wockhardt and contribution from new products including the Avigan (favipiravir) and remdesivir launched for the treatment of COVID-19.  It further strengthened the development pipeline for COVID-19 treatment drugs including the vaccine candidate Sputnik V.  Revenue from pharmaceutical services and active ingredients (PSAI) segment grew by 20 percent at Rs 850.5 crore in Q2FY21.  Proprietary products and other revenue fell 92 percent YoY to Rs 62.1 crore as the year-ago quarter received income from sale of the US and select territory rights for two of neurology franchise products.  &amp;quot;During the quarter, we saw gradual recovery in the market demand across India, Russia and other markets after a low demand in Ql FY 21, although the demand is yet to fully recover to pre-COVID levels,&amp;quot; Dr Reddy's said.  At the operating level, its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell 11 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,276.3 crore and margin declined 400 bps YoY to 25.9 percent in Q2FY21, but were ahead of CNBC-TV18 poll estimates of Rs 1,115 crore and 24 percent respectively.  &amp;quot;Gross profit margin declined 360 bps over previous year, impacted due to inclusion of revenue from sale of Neurology franchise products in the previous year, partially offset by improvement in productivity and favourable forex rates,&amp;quot; company said.  Sequentially the margin reduced by 210 bps, primarily on account of lower export incentives, adverse forex and product mix, it added.

Any green shoots in the segment indicate a direct pick-up in the economy. And there are signs aplenty, not just at Tata Motors, but at its rivals as well.","After a washout in the June quarter, one of India&rsquo;s largest commercial vehicle (CV) makers,&nbsp;Tata Motors,&nbsp;has started to record a pickup in demand. The uptick has been driven by greater fleet utilisation, resumption of vehicle finance by banks, firming up of freight rates and new infrastructure contracts being awarded.  Almost every segment of the CV industry &mdash; small, intermediate, light, medium and heavy &mdash; has witnessed a rise in demand starting September. The bus segment is the only one where demand remains poor, say company officials.  The passenger vehicle and two-wheeler segments had rebounded much earlier with September being the second consecutive month of positive growth in volume.  Relief for CV makers  PB Balaji, Chief Financial Officer, Tata Motors, said: &ldquo;About a month or two back there were concerns around the pace of recovery of commercial vehicles. But as September ended and the way October has played out, we are very clearly seeing the commercial vehicle business also coming into the equation.&rdquo;  From a 90 percent fall in the June quarter and then 40 percent in the September quarter, the fall shrank dramatically in the month of September to just 4 percent for Tata Motors. While the numbers for October are expected in the first week of November, Balaji added that the upward momentum has continued in this month.  &ldquo;We can say that small commercial vehicles are back to growth. Intermediate and light commercial vehicles have started to see good momentum starting September. Medium and heavy commercial vehicles have come back to demand growth. The tipper segment has done very well thanks to mining projects, port and road projects all being cleared. Cargo is coming back too,&rdquo; added Balaji.  &nbsp;Peers also do well  The commercial vehicle segment is often regarded as a barometer of economic activity in a country. Any green shoots in the CV segment indicate a direct pick up in the economy. And there are signs aplenty, not just at Tata Motors, but at its rivals as well.  For Chennai-based&nbsp;Ashok Leyland&nbsp;the recovery has been even better. The company recorded a 2 percent increase in volumes of medium and heavy trucks and a 20 percent rise in volumes of light commercial vehicles during the month of September.  Mumbai-based&nbsp;Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra&nbsp;arrested the fall in September, reporting 0.18 percent growth in volumes. Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland and Mahindra control more than 80 percent of the domestic CV industry.  &ldquo;Financing concerns are starting to abate. We are seeing an improvement in the loan recovery rate and that is ensuring financing is coming back into the segment. I see most of the issues of commercial vehicles resolved in the next three months or so. We are cautiously optimistic that the worst is over for commercial vehicles,&rdquo; added Balaji.  &ldquo;Things are moving faster than we are extrapolating and therefore we have seen the fleet utilisation rate moving up, which is seen in the e-way bill, toll collection and fuel consumption. Another indicator is our non-auto business, where we have the spare parts and servicing business, which has also started to pick up,&rdquo; added Balaji.","Auto, Business, Tata Motors, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/the-worst-is-behind-usthe-cv-segment-tata-motors_14422141.html

L&amp;amp;amp;T bagged orders worth Rs 28,039 crore at the Group level during the quarter, registering a sequential improvement of 19 percent over the previous quarter, but a decline of 42 percent from the previous year on account of deferment of award decisions largely caused by the pandemic.  International orders during the quarter constituted 36 percent of the total order inflow. &amp;quot;The consolidated order book of the Group stood at Rs 2,98,856 crore as of September 2020, with international order book constituting 24 percent of the total order book,&amp;quot; L&amp;amp;amp;T said.  Cash generation from operations was robust during the quarter which was strongly supplemented by proceeds from the divestment of electrical &amp;amp;amp; automation business, company said.  Hence the company has declared a special dividend of Rs 18 per equity share to mark the successful completion of the divestment.

The company has partnered with KARWA&nbsp;under technology transfer from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). As part of this collaborative effort, Cipla will be responsible for the marketing and distribution of the SARS CoV-2-IgG antibody detection ELISA that will be manufactured by KARWA. ICMR has provided the requisite technological knowhow and process for developing the test kits to approved manufacturers.  The product will be marketed under the brand name &lsquo;ELIFast&rsquo;. Cipla&rsquo;s expansive distribution network will help in ensuring seamless supply of kits across the country. Supply will be undertaken through channels approved by ICMR to ensure equitable access. IgG antibody tests identify the immune status of individuals to the COVID-19 infection. ICMR has recommended these tests for conducting sero-surveillance. The latter may help in determining the burden of&nbsp;COVID-19 at the community level and monitor trends in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection. ELIfast has been validated and approved by ICMR and the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. It is found to have specificity and sensitivity of 99.33 percent and 92 percent, respectively. The kit is user friendly with a simple protocol, ready-to-use reagents and is compatible with common ELISA equipment.

CEO Erez Israeli said the company would begin phase&nbsp;II trials in the next few days.  Dr Reddy's recently received permission from DCGI to conduct phase&nbsp;II and&nbsp;III trials of the Russian vaccine. In phase II, it will be enrolling 100 participants. If it&nbsp;receives an&nbsp;approval to continue, it will recruit 1,400 subjects for phase III, Israeli said. Phase&nbsp;III will follow after the completion of phase&nbsp;II trials.  &ldquo;I hope we will finish phase II by December, which means not just the enrolment and the trial but also compilations of results,&amp;quot; Israeli said.  If everything goes smoothly, the trial is expected to be completed by March-end, but if there any delays in compilation and submission, it could take up to mid-May, he explained. &amp;quot;Data from India will be complemented by the global clinical trial data of the vaccine.&amp;quot;  In September, Dr Reddy&rsquo;s and Russia&rsquo;s sovereign wealth -- the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) -- entered into a partnership to conduct clinical trials of Sputnik V vaccine and its distribution in India. As part of deal, RDIF shall supply 100 million doses of the vaccine to Dr Reddy&rsquo;s upon regulatory approval in India.  Israeli said the vaccine will be produced in India, at a third party site in Baddi, but declined to offer details on the vaccine pricing.  Sputnik V, the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Moscow&rsquo;s Gamaleya Institute, the Russian Defence Ministry and the sovereign Russian Direct Investment Fund, became the first vaccine to be cleared for public use. The results of Sputnik V of phase I/II clinical trials on 76 people were published in medical journal The Lancet in early September, showing that the vaccine candidate triggered a strong immune response. Russia is enrolling 40,000 volunteers as part of phase III trails, starting September, and will take six months to complete.

APE declined 3.5% YoY to Rs. 27.1bn but more than doubled sequentially. The savings APE declined 9.2% to Rs. 23.7bn while the protection APE grew 70% to Rs. 3.4bn. We expect SBILIFE&rsquo;s APE growth to be on par with the industry&rsquo;s. Individual savings APE declined 15% YoY to Rs. 21.1bn and comprise of 78% of the overall mix (Q2FY20: 88% Q1FY21: 75%). Although ULIP APE continued to decline (-13% YoY), the product has seen some recovery visible in the strong sequential performance which is aided by the larger share of debt.

Standard loan cover stood at 0.6% of advances as of Sep-end, same as last quarter. Management noted that the stock of provisions the bank held was adequate and conservative. Despite weak growth trends, continued moderation in CoF has aided NII growth. Growth should not be a challenge eventually, given the comfort on CoF. We expect incremental asset quality risks to be limited for KMB owing to its conservative stance on lending and strong risk practices.

438,2020-10-29 12:25:09+05:30,Larsen & Toubro Ltd.,LT,"L&amp;amp;T in talks with SBI, Telangana government to bail out cash-strapped Hyderabad metro rail project","The Telangana government, however, has its own fiscal challenges due to the loss of tax revenue on account of Covid-19, a high debt burden and the recent floods that devastated capital city Hyderabad and its adjoining districts ","Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro (L&amp;amp;amp;T), operator of the Hyderabad metro rail project, said it is in discussions with State Bank of India (SBI) and the Telangana government to make the project financially viable.  &ldquo;There is huge finance involved; there are other aspects involved. We are in constant dialogue with the government of Telangana and (lead banker) SBI to see what is best from a financial point of view to refinance the project and make it viable,&rdquo; said SN Subrahmanyan, CEO &amp;amp;amp; MD of L&amp;amp;amp;T, during the company&rsquo;s post-earnings media call on Wednesday.  Subrahmanyan said he was assured by Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao that the State would do what is required to get the metro rail project back on track.  &ldquo;We are cautiously optimistic that better sense will prevail. This being a huge investment, the government also considers it as their project,&rdquo; the L&amp;amp;amp;T boss added.  A matter of interest  Subrahmanyan declined to comment on the specific financial assistance he was seeking from the government, but hinted it had to do with compensating for the interest incurred.  &ldquo;It is nothing but the interest loss; the project has got nearly Rs 14,000 crore of debt, and therefore the loss is about Rs 1,400 crore, which is nothing but the interest cost,&rdquo; Subrahmanyan said.  &ldquo;Otherwise, if the traffic is normal and such, the project breaks even at the EBITDA level. We have to find ways and means to reduce the debt level, thereby bringing the project to more viable levels,&rdquo; Subrahmanyan added.  Hyderabad metro rail is L&amp;amp;amp;T&rsquo;s single biggest investment in a project. It has invested over Rs 19,000 crore on the project through debt, equity and a grant from the Central government.  Covid impact L&amp;amp;amp;T fully commissioned the Hyderabad metro rail project in February 2020. In March it saw a daily ridership of 500,000 people. Operations came to a grinding halt towards the end of March due to the nationwide lockdown imposed to contain Covid-19.  After being fully shut for over five months, the metro rail began partial operations on September 7. Operations are being resumed in a graded manner. Ridership has only reached 100,000 on a daily basis, as many commuters are keeping away from the metro, fearing a Covid-19 infection, and this is making the recovery all the more challenging.  While the lockdown had put the brakes on operations and cash flows, L&amp;amp;amp;T continued to incur fixed operational costs, depreciation and interest expenses. All this raised serious questions on the financial viability of the project, which is also burdening L&amp;amp;amp;T&rsquo;s balance sheet at the consolidated level.  In the first half of FY21, the Hyderabad metro managed to make only Rs 550 crore, way below the costs it incurs. Indeed, L&amp;amp;amp;T Hyderabad Metro Rail suffered a net loss of Rs 382 crore in FY20. Total revenues stood at Rs 1,370 crore.  Tricky time  Moneycontrol had earlier reported&nbsp;about the possibility of L&amp;amp;amp;T threatening to invoke the &lsquo;force majeure&rsquo; clause in the concession agreement to walk out of the project in the case of unforeseen events.  But things are more complicated on the ground, as the Telangana government finds itself in a tough fiscal situation due to the loss of tax revenue on account of Covid-19, a high debt burden and the recent floods that devastated capital city Hyderabad and its adjoining districts.  The company is also weighing other options, including monetising land banks that it received as part of the concessionaire agreement, and even a possible divestment.  But the timing hasn't been right for L&amp;amp;amp;T, given how the Covid-19 pandemic has hit real estate demand, especially for commercial and office space, as employers have adopted the work from home option.

Net interest income during the quarter is expected to increase around 10 percent YoY with around a percent loan growth and 10 percent growth in deposits compared to the year-ago period.  &amp;quot;We expect a weak performance on operating metrics. Loan growth will likely be at around 1 percent YoY while NIM (reported) is likely to decline to 4 percent as we expect a slower decline in cost of funds as compared to the decline in lending yields. We expect a weaker performance on fee income growth,&amp;quot; said Kotak Institutional Equities.

Motilal Oswal also feels loan growth will continue to witness pressure, while deposits will show strong traction on QoQ basis.  &amp;quot;Asset quality will remain pressured, led by higher strain on MFI and auto businesses; collection efficiency is key,&amp;quot; said the brokerage.  Commentary on commercial vehicle portfolio, expected restructuring of loans by Q4 FY21 and guidance on credit costs given the exposures that are also likely to be affected by COVID would be the key monitorable.","IndusInd Bank, Result Poll","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/result-poll/indusind-bank-q2-preview-profit-may-fall-sharply-amid-higher-covid-19-related-provisions_14430181.html

M&amp;amp;M holds nearly 100% stake in Mahindra Electric, one of India&rsquo;s largest electric vehicle makers. M&amp;amp;M hopes that investors will help it achieve the goal of securing $100 million for product development.","The Mahindra Group-controlled Mahindra Electric Mobility, which has been looking for investors for the past few months, has received offers from multiple companies for a stake buy, a top company official said.  Mahindra Electric Mobility is one of India&rsquo;s largest electric vehicle makers, with cars, cargo vans and passenger three-wheelers in its portfolio. The company, formed in 2010, has been making losses for the group.  Nearly 100 percent stake is held in the Bengaluru-based company by&nbsp;Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra&nbsp;(M&amp;amp;amp;M). The company was formerly known as Reva Electric Car company.  M&amp;amp;amp;M hopes that investors will help it achieve the goal of securing $100 million for product development. A few suitors are believed to have gone through the due diligence process.  &lsquo;Offers being finalised&rsquo;  Pawan Goenka, Managing Director, M&amp;amp;amp;M, said on Thursday: &ldquo;We have said in the past that we are looking at potential investors in Mahindra Electric and we have significant interest from many players. E-commerce delivery service providers, pure financial investors and strategic investors are some of the companies. We are in the process of finalising the offers from these players. I don&rsquo;t want to put a date because these things do take time but I can say that the plan is progressing as per plan.&rdquo;  In 2019-20, Mahindra Electric clocked sales of 14,602 units (966 four-wheelers and 13,636 three-wheelers), a growth of 42 percent compared to 10,276 units (1,811 four-wheelers and 8,455 three-wheelers). The company had a turnover of Rs 279 crore last financial year and a net loss of Rs 55 crore.  By the time the stricter Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) norms (global norms that are aimed at lowering fuel consumption) are introduced in India by 2022, M&amp;amp;amp;M will have a &lsquo;substantial size&rsquo; of electric vehicles in its portfolio, Goenka had said in August.  Delay in launches  Some of the launch plans of M&amp;amp;amp;M in the EV space are running a few months late. The electric version of the KUV compact SUV, which was to make its way in the first quarter of this year will now be likely launched in the last quarter. Next year will probably see the electric version of the electric XUV300.  Mahindra Electric Mobility has invested in development of the next-generation EV platform MESMA 350. The Mahindra Electric Scalable and Modular Architecture 350 is a 350-volt powertrain that supports motor sizes ranging from 60 kW to 280 kW, dual motor concepts and battery sizes up to 80 kWh.  On October 29, Mahindra Electric launched the cargo three-wheeler TreoZor for Rs 2.73 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi), two years after the company launched the Treo passenger carrier. The TreoZor, which will come in three platforms &ndash; pickup, delivery van and flatbed &ndash; will have a payload of 550kg.  Mahindra Electric is the largest player from the organised segment in the electric three-wheeler space, having sold 5,000 vehicles till date. The TreoZor is priced higher than Kinetic Green&rsquo;s 500kg payload Safar Jumbo, which comes for Rs 2.5 lakh. The Safar Jumbo was launched earlier this week.","Auto, Business, Mahindra, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/mahindra-electric-mobility-gets-offers-for-stake-buycompany_14431901.html

Other business segments too especially DTH reported healthy performance. Bharti&rsquo;s strong business trajectory, reasonable valuations (~8/6.4x FY21/22E EV/EBITDA) should re-impose investor confidence and lead to reversal of some of its recent underperformance.

The automotive industry was keenly eyeing demand revival during this period. The first 10 days of the festival period accounts for 30-40 percent of the entire festive period sales.  In the week&rsquo;s news wrap on the industry, we take a look at how the festive days panned out for two-wheeler manufacturers. But before that, here&rsquo;s a look at what else made headline during the week.  Tata Motors and Maruti Suzuki announce Q2&nbsp;earnings&nbsp;  Tata Motors,&nbsp;the country's largest commercial vehicle maker and owner of luxury car brand Jaguar Land Rover, posted a consolidated loss of Rs 314.5 crore in the quarter ended September 30.  India's largest passenger vehicle manufacturer,&nbsp;Maruti Suzuki India, reported a one percent year-on-year growth in Q2 FY21 standalone profit on October 29.  Hero MotoCorp-Harley-Davidson announce India tie-up  Hero MotoCorp&nbsp;and Harley-Davidson have kept their partnership open to include more agreements in future including joint development of products as the Indian bike maker aims to go after the premium segment aggressively.  Following the October 27 announcement which said Hero will sell and service Harley products in India as part of a licensing agreement, a senior Hero MotoCorp official has confirmed that the partnership will keep &lsquo;expanding and extending&rsquo; in future  Maruti Suzuki says there is no need for a GST cut  There is no need for an immediate cut in Goods and Services Tax (GST) on automobiles since demand is upbeat, said Chairman of&nbsp;Maruti Suzuki&nbsp;RC Bhargava.  The Delhi-based car maker sold nearly 10,000 cars every day during the ten days of Navratri and Dussera festivities.  TVS records 29 percent decline in Q2 net profit&nbsp;  TVS Motor Company&nbsp;on&nbsp;October 29 reported a 29.37 per cent decline in consolidated net profit at Rs 181.41 crore for the quarter ended September.  The company had posted a net profit of Rs 256.88 crore in the July-September period of the previous fiscal.  Mercedes delivers 550 cars in festive days  German luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz on Monday said it delivered 550 cars during Navratri and Dussehra thus driving into a robust festive season.  The deliveries were in Mumbai, Gujarat, Delhi NCR and other Northern markets. The festive season deliveries in the Delhi-NCR region stood at 175 units and there is an anticipation of strong demand for upcoming Diwali and Dhanteras period, Mercedes-Benz India said in a statement.  Navratri turns out to be a mixed bag for two-wheelers  The festive period has brought about mixed reactions from the auto industry.  While some dealers associated with the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association said Navratri and Dussera sales were a major disappointment, others such as two-wheeler manufacturers &ndash; Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor Company and Royal Enfield &ndash; have spoken about medium to strong pick up in volumes for the same period compared to previous non-festive days.  Senior management of the country&rsquo;s largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp said the company nearly surpassed Navratri-Dussera sales recorded last year.  Speaking to analysts in a conference call Niranjan Gupta, CFO, Hero MotoCorp said, &ldquo;In the first ten days of the festive period we have registered 96 percent of retail compared to the previous level. The enquiries moving forward are very encouraging and we are confident of a good festive season. Semi-urban and urban are getting on the trend.&rdquo;  Demand for two-wheelers made by Bajaj Auto during the first five days of the season was on par with the same period last year. The company had rolled out special offers on some of its products including the Pulsar 125 where it was offering Rs 3,000 discount.  &ldquo;The first few days of the season suggests that demand is at similar levels. The walk-ins, the inquiries, et cetera, seem to be at a similar level. So let's see how the next few days go. These are very important. However, we are very pleased in the domestic motorcycles,&rdquo; said Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto in an analyst conference call.  While pan-India sales numbers were not made available but niche bike maker Royal Enfield said that across Maharashtra 3700 motorcycles from 92 dealerships were delivered by it during the ten festive days including 1200 in Mumbai in Dussera.  FADA has promised to share data for the entire festive period comprising 30-40 days after Diwali. This will include data for Navratri and Dussera as well. Still, the retail sales that will be shared by FADA will not have data of a few states like Madhya Pradesh and Telangana.  Naveen Chauhan, head of sales and aftersales, Hero MotoCorp said, &ldquo;There is a lot of positivity among our dealers. The first ten days of the festive period generates one-third of the sales planned for the entire festival period and it is going accordingly. There are three states that do not share data which make up 18-20 percent of our numbers.&amp;quot;","Auto, Business, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/this-weekauto-festive-season-brings-some-cheer-to-two-wheeler-majorsis-it-time-yet-to-celebrate_14437541.html

However, notably the growth was led entirely by rupee depreciation of 3.8% y-o-y. The sales decline has been at around 3.7% y-o-y, dollar revenue basis. The reason for the fall in dollar revenue was decline in the revenue of all the verticals&rsquo; revenue except healthcare. Communication and technology verticals experienced the sharpest revenue decline y-o-y in Q2-2021 followed by energy, BFSI and consumer. The revenue decline was also driven by decline in revenue of Americas and Europe (major segments) while rest of the world showed increase y-o-y. As per the following, it shows that the constant dollar revenue growth is still negative for Wipro on a y-o-y basis. So, the recovery is not still evident to the pre-COVID levels. Outlook The company is trading at 22x TTM PE (as of Q2-2021) against an industry average TTM PE of 27x. The company generates ROE of 16.9% against industry peers generating average ROE of 26%. As a result, we believe the company is steeply undervalued at the current PE levels. On a forward PE basis, we value the company at 28x its estimated FY2022 EPS of Rs. 21 and at 23x its estimated FY2023 EPS of Rs. 26. On a TTM PE basis, we value Wipro shares at 34x TTM PE (as of Q2-2021) and assign it a target value at Rs. 586 a share over medium term. We believe the PE as of Q2-2021 will expand up-to 34x over a period of time to catch up with the fair valuation on a DCF basis we arrive at as follows.

Experts say that current laws in relation to capital reduction and fair value of assets, require the recipient (SP Group) to pay charge on deemed dividend (to the extent of distributing free reserves) and capital gains tax (on assets over and above free reserves) to the Centre, Business Standard reported.  The Mistrys have 18.4 percent stake (worth Rs 1.78 lakh crore) in Tata Sons, which as of March 2020 had free reserves of Rs 45,545 crore. The tax would thus be hefty, requiring the Mistrys to sell shares in listed Tata group companies to build the amount.  Ketan Dalal, Managing Partner at Katalyst Advisors LLP told the paper that the capital reduction would likely be conducted under the Companies Act by a National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).  &ldquo;Tax would depend on 'methodology of the payment, such as payment in cash against payment in kind or a combination of both&hellip; the general provisions of tax laws applicable to capital reduction, the recipient would be chargeable to deemed dividend (to the extent of the distributing company's free reserves) and in relation to the fair value of assets over and above such free reserves, there would be capital gains.

SP Group submitted a plan of separation to the Supreme Court on October 29, seeking non-cash settlement in form of shares in all listed Tata entities where Tata Sons owns stake &ndash; basis pro rata split of listed assets (per known share price value) and pro rata split of brand (as per valuation done and published by Tatas).  The ask would mean that for the Tatas 72 percent ownership in Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the SP Group's ownership of 18.37 per cent in Tata Sons would entitle them to 13.22 percent stake in TCS worth Rs 1,35,000 crore at present market capitalisation, as per the statement.  The Tatas had last told the Supreme Court that they were willing to buy out the Mistrys&rsquo; share. Sources said they would respond to the latest settlement offer in court, the report added.","Business, Companies, India, SP Group, stocks, Tata Sons, TCS","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/mistrysÃ¢ÂÂ-tata-sons-exit-plan-to-bring-tax-windfall-forcentre-report_14442781.html
473,2020-11-02 17:52:19+05:30,Hero MotoCorp Ltd.,HEROMOTOCO,Two-wheeler sales see a strong jump in October on festive demand,"Barring Eicher Motors-controlled Royal Enfield, India&rsquo;s top five two-wheeler makers &ndash; Hero MotoCorp, Honda, Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor, Suzuki and Yamaha &ndash; reported an increase in domestic sales in October","Motorcycle and scooter makers recorded their biggest monthly growth this year in October, with dealers putting repeat orders to cater to the rising retail demand.  Barring Eicher Motors-controlled Royal Enfield, India&rsquo;s top six two-wheeler makers &ndash; Hero MotoCorp, Honda,&nbsp;Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor, Suzuki and Yamaha &ndash; reported an increase in domestic sales in October.  The&nbsp;seven companies, which control nearly 100 percent of the domestic market, reported 17 percent increase in sales during October to 2.04 million units, compared to 1.74 million units sold in the same month last year.  These are wholesale vehicle dispatches from companies to dealers and not actual retail sales to customers. Retail sales data will be disclosed by the dealer&rsquo;s lobby body in the next few days.  Strong retail sales during Navratri and Dussehra were the primary reason behind the uptick in volumes during October. Additionally, market watchers attribute the increase to the tendency of dealers to build up inventory to meet demand during the Diwali period. Consumer offers, cheaper loans, and new launches also helped push sales.  Hero MotoCorp, the country&rsquo;s biggest two-wheeler maker, recorded 35 percent increase in volumes in October at 7.91 lakh units, compared to 5.86 lakh units recorded in the same month last year. This is one of the highest monthly sales clocked by the leader of budget bike segment.  &ldquo;In the first ten days of the festive period, we have registered 96 percent of last year's sales. The enquiries moving forward are very encouraging, and we are confident of a good festive season. Semi-urban and urban are getting on the trend,&amp;quot; Niranjan Gupta, CFO, Hero MotoCorp told to analysts.  Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI), the country&rsquo;s second largest two-wheeler maker reported the slowest growth among the top four two-wheeler makers. HMSI wholesale volumes grew just 1 percent in October to 4.94 lakh units as compared to 4.87 lakh units posted in the same month last year.  Chennai-based TVS Motor Company, the third largest domestic two-wheeler player, recorded 19 percent growth in volumes during October to 3.01 lakh units as against 2.42 lakh units sold in the same month last year.  Pune-based Bajaj Auto recorded the second slowest growth in sales during October among the top four companies though the company said that at 1.7 lakh units the Pulsar range saw its best-ever monthly sales performance. The maker of Avenger cruisers Bajaj recorded 11 percent growth in October sales to 2.68 lakh units as against 2.42 lakh units recorded during the same month last year.  Royal Enfield was the only two-wheeler maker that recorded a drop during October. The maker of motorcycles like Classic 350 and Himalayan posted a fall of 7 percent in domestic volumes to 62,858 units during the month as against 67,538 units clocked in the same month last year.  On October 29, Royal Enfield issued a press release stating it had sold 3,700 bikes in Maharashtra during the festive 10 days, including 1,200 bikes in Mumbai on Dussehra.  &ldquo;There has been a steady demand in the market&nbsp;and the momentum is continuing. The booking levels are encouraging and a promising sign for the upcoming months. While there was some pent-up demand in the market, the recent business recovery and steady sales figures could be safely attributed to the fresh demand being generated,&amp;quot; Royal Enfield had said.  The other two Japanese two-wheeler makers, Suzuki and Yamaha, recorded 2 percent and 31 percent increase, respectively in October sales.","Auto, Bajaj Auto, Business, Eicher Motors, Hero Motocorp, stocks, Suzuki, Technology, TVS Motor, video, Yamaha","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/two-wheeler-sales-seestrong-jumpoctoberfestive-demand_14443601.html

Prabhudas Lilladher also feels Taro may continue underperform due to pricing pressure in derma products, while specialty products ramp-up may also to be lower-than-expected and India formulation could decline in lower single-digit YoY. The brokerage sees 0.2 percent decline in revenue YoY.  Sun Pharma's key facility Halol continues to be under FDA issue which has slowed down new approvals.  At operating level, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) in September quarter may grow more than 10 percent and margin could expand around 200 bps compared to year-ago period, driven by operational cost saving due to COVID-19.  The stock gained 8.5 percent year-to-date 2020 and 5.8 percent in the quarter ended September, while it shot up 45 percent from its March lows.

478,2020-11-03 09:13:09+05:30,UltraTech Cement Ltd.,ULTRACEMCO,Is the post COVID recovery a blip?,Disaggregate data points are directionally pointing at a much firmer recovery than anticipated,"Highlights -&nbsp;IT and telecom were the expected winners from Q2 FY21 earnings season - Cement was a positive surprise along with certain discretionary consumption categories - Premium consumption still on a tentative wicket - Auto benefitting from preference for personal mobility - Significant improvement in collection efficiency of banks points to broad-based normalization of activities  In the run-up to the Q2 FY21 earning season, we had expected the beneficiaries of the new normal like the technology and telecom sectors to post a strong show and almost every other company to report a huge sequential improvement as the April-June quarter was a washout for most businesses impacted by the lockdown.  The early trends from Q2 were more or less on expected lines with most large technology companies surpassing our optimistic assumptions, thanks to a significant acceleration in investment by enterprises on technology in the areas of cloud and digital with operational efficiencies and cost reduction propelling margins.  The surprise winner  We were pleasantly surprised when besides the usual suspects, purely domestic demand driven cement companies surprised the Street positively. Contrary to expectations of no growth, the three leading pan India players - UltraTech, ACC and Ambuja - reported YoY (year-on-year) volume growth and their adept management of cost resulted in enviable margins. Housing-led demand reportedly made a strong comeback while infrastructure activities were showing early signs of a pick-up.  Is the consumption mojo back?  If this was somewhat of an aberration, the entire consumption pack virtually left no doubts that this recovery cannot be just brushed aside as pent-up demand from the June quarter. Staples, that was already in a secured spot amid the lockdown, strengthened its position with genuine demand revival. Many frontline players like Britannia, Colgate and Marico reported strong YoY volume growth. Not only staples, discretionary categories had a genuine revival story to share as well.  Titan, the true blue discretionary consumption play, saw a near normal September with the flagship jewellery segment returning to near pre-COVID levels. The same positive vibes came from the earnings report of Asian Paints that witnessed YoY double digit growth in decorative paints volume.  Quasi discretionary categories like electricals &ndash; fans, lighting, fast moving electrical goods - also threw a positive surprise as seen from the numbers of Havells, Crompton Consumers and Polycab with YoY growth on the back of demand coming from the retail segment although institutional business was still weak.  After a quarter of austerity, consumers said cheers in Q2 as RadicoKhaitan saw a YoY growth in its volumes.  Are we back to the pre-COVID days? Not entirely. While there is no permanent destruction in demand as is evident from the report card of consumption companies, the economy is still far from firing. Check this: Hindustan Unilever, again a bellwether consumption company, saw its FMCG category grow but premium discretionary items saw a huge decline resulting in overall tepid growth in volumes. Even for Asian Paints, the growth was led by the economy category with premium taking a back seat. So while consumers are out of the phase of fear, they are yet not optimistic enough to splurge.  The post-COVID commuters  COVID has unleashed a change in consumer behaviour at all levels and not just in the use of e-commerce as a preferred mode of shopping. The concern over avoiding crowds has resulted in a strong surge in demand for two-wheelers, the cheapest mode of personal mobility as well as passenger cars. This is reflected in the positive YoY volume growth of Bajaj Auto, Hero, Maruti and also a stellar show of Tata Motor&rsquo;s passenger vehicle business. However, cautious commuters are shunning public transport. That explains the decline in three wheeler sales in recent times. We expect a positive rub off on the ancillary segment from the automotive revival.  Needless to mention, the very good monsoons, encouraging kharif sowing, rural-specific fiscal sops and record water levels have all added to the positive sentiment especially in the rural areas.  Will investment follow suit?  Will the positivity in consumption reflect in the companies riding on the capital expenditure (investment demand) theme &ndash; not entirely, but the early signs are heartening, nevertheless.  Steel companies like JSW that managed to keep its head above water in Q1 with exports, saw strong traction from domestic market in Q2 with volumes growing YoY. Similar strength was seen in the demand for zinc as well.  Pure play investment themes are not yet out of the woods, however. Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro&rsquo;s flagship EPC business continued to report a YoY decline, although a much improved show compared to Q1 and the company dispelled concerns about labour availability impacting execution.  Industrial activity is gradually picking up as Cummins India, a company that has its pulse on industrial revival is seeing early traction from diverse areas. Consumer facing manufacturers like Dixon are witnessing strong demand traction, suggestive of demand returning to pre-COVID levels in several pockets.  However, a full blown revival in investment may not be on the horizon yet.  Are the lenders sensing a return to normalcy?  A discussion on revival is incomplete without a key constituent &ndash; the lenders, who undoubtedly have their ears on the ground. While the moratorium, followed by the Supreme Court&rsquo;s order on non-classification of NPAs, has largely masked the reported NPA picture, the commentary from banks is insightful. Most large banks like HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank or IndusInd Bank have seen collection efficiency steadily improving with September figures upwards of 95 percent barring a few minuscule troubled pockets. Even large NBFCs having significant coverage like M&amp;amp;amp;M Finance or Shriram are witnessing similar collection efficiency, a clear indication that the pain so far is much less than was initially feared.  While these disaggregate data points are directionally pointing at a much firmer recovery than anticipated, there will be wide variations. Not all categories are uniformly participating and not all companies equally benefitting. Note that the earnings report card so far is that of better-managed, savvy players. Hence, investors will have to continue to tread with caution and evaluate the merit of individual business.","Business, Companies, macro, Moneycontrol Research, quarterly earnings","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/madhuchanda-dey-7445/', 'name': 'Madhuchanda Dey'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/ispost-covid-recoveryblip_14446661.html
479,2020-11-03 12:17:23+05:30,HDFC Bank Ltd.,HDFCBANK,Large banks hold up well in Q2 but experts say too early to celebrate,"A clear picture of how the coronavirus outbreak has hit the banking sector will emerge only after some quarters once the Reserve Bank of India's support wounds up, analysts say. ","The September quarter earnings show that most banking players, especially the larger ones, held up&nbsp;well despite the coronavirus outbreak but experts say the sector is not completely out of woods&nbsp;yet.  Most large private banks reported improved net profits for the second&nbsp;quarter and a modest increase in bad loans, experts said.  Top private-sector lenders such as&nbsp;HDFC Bank,&nbsp;ICICI Bank&nbsp;and&nbsp;Axis Bank&nbsp;posted a strong sequential&nbsp;improvement in their profits. They also reported sequential improvement in their gross non-performing&nbsp;assets (NPAs) ratio.  The impact of staggered roll back of lockdown restrictions, or &ldquo;Unlocking&rdquo;, and resumption of economic activities is&nbsp;visible in the banks&rsquo; quarterly results.  The opening up of the economy also led to an improvement in loan repayment and a major reduction in the&nbsp;moratorium book but it may be too early to celebrate.  Looming uncertainty  A clear picture of how COVID-19 hit the banking sector will emerge only after some quarters once the Reserve Bank of India's support&nbsp;wounds up.  According to experts, the challenges for the sector range from an increase in slippages from moratorium&nbsp;books, restructuring the percentage of the loan book to quality growth.  Devang Mehta, Head &ndash; Equity Advisory, Centrum Wealth Management, said the actual picture&nbsp;of the COVID blow to banks will only emerge over the next couple of quarters, as special dispensations&nbsp;provided by the RBI start to wind down.  The gross NPA numbers do not show the full picture of stressed accounts&nbsp;for private banks, he said. It is, however, important to remember that these banks have been providing aggressively&nbsp;during the first six months of this financial year.  Nirali Shah, Senior Research Analyst, Samco Securities has a similar view.  &amp;quot;Prima facie, it appears that the banking sector managed to tide through one more quarter amid the&nbsp;pandemic with healthy profitability and a modest increase in bad loans. But, the actual pain could emerge&nbsp;only after a few quarters when the special dispensations provided by the RBI start to dwindle,&amp;quot; Shah said.  Shah sees a number of challenges.  &amp;quot;The top challenge is reporting of NPLs. Even though most banks have reported sequential improvement in&nbsp;their asset quality, the truth is that the reported NPAs may not have captured all the stress on the bank&rsquo;s&nbsp;balance sheet. In fact, a proforma number has been reported as the apex court has asked lenders not to&nbsp;classify any new account as NPA after August 31, 2020. This will very well push the NPAs to a future date,&nbsp;causing banks to delay their provision requirement,&amp;quot; Shah said.  Another challenge lies in the amounts reported as restructured loans, which are extremely small to date, he said.&nbsp;The true proportions of restructuring will emerge in the quarters ending December and March.  &ldquo;Collection efficiency reported by banks is still running below their pre-COVID-19 levels,&nbsp;especially on the unsecured side which will be a key measure to watch out for going forward,&rdquo; said Shah. The&nbsp;road ahead is challenging and a clear picture will be visible only in the quarters to come,&nbsp;he added.  As per the RBI&rsquo;s June 2020 financial stability report, the bad loan rate is expected to climb to 14.2 percent in a&nbsp;severe stress scenario and 12.5 percent in a baseline scenario as of March 2021, which is a bit alarming.&nbsp;Due to standstill benefits banks didn&rsquo;t recognise further slippages in Q2FY21 but in the next two-three quarters, NPAs&nbsp;are expected to rise.  The improvement in collection efficiency after the end of the moratorium on August 31 is positive.  &amp;quot;After the end of the moratorium on August 31, the improvement in collection efficiency has been ahead of our&nbsp;estimates with large banks on an average having a collection efficiency of 95 percent for the month of September,&rdquo; Jehan Bhadha, Assistant Vice President - Equity Research at Nirmal Bang said.  This figure is expected to improve further by the December quarter. With the encouraging&nbsp;collections, banks have started to accelerate disbursement growth which has reached pre- COVID&nbsp;levels, Bhadha said.  Should you avoid the sector?  The valuation of some of the banking stocks is cheap at this juncture while the outlook of&nbsp;some has improved. So, one can bet on select players from the sector.  Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said the banking sector is a value buy, given&nbsp;the inexpensive valuation and improved outlook in the long-term.  Valuation wise, the Nifty Bank is trading at a 1-year forward P/B of 1.7 times compared&nbsp;to it the last 3 year average of 2.3 times, he said.  The challenges have been factored in in the prices and financial stress will reduce as the&nbsp;economy and demand improve.  &amp;quot;For the short to medium-term, the sector is under concern given the weakening asset quality and low&nbsp;credit growth, adding uncertainties in analyzing and forecasting a fair book-value. But the sector is getting back and reported better operational performance in Q2FY21, even though credit growth has to improve,&amp;quot;&nbsp; Nair said.  &amp;quot;A complete change depends on when the pandemic will subside, which is expected during 2021. Hence,&nbsp;strong buying in the SIP method over the next 6 to 12 months is advisable to build a strong portfolio in&nbsp;banking services.&amp;quot;  Nair's top picks are HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank in the private space, Bajaj Finance in NBFC, Bandhan&nbsp;in rural and microfinance and IDFC First as an upcoming bank.  Jaikishan Parmar, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Angel Broking, is of the view that due to adequate&nbsp;liquidity and sufficient capital, large banks will gain market share. He has a positive view on&nbsp;ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and IDFC First Bank.  Shah from Samco Securities said balance sheets of Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank and ICICI Banks are&nbsp;likely better equipped to sustain the pain than PSUs in the months to come.  Mehta of Centrum Wealth Management also likes larger franchises, particularly HDFC Bank and Kotak&nbsp;Mahindra Bank, as they are equipped to handle difficult times and have the potential to gain market share&nbsp;from smaller players.  Bhadha of Nirmal Bang is bullish on ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank.

On a like to like basis, growth has been 3% supported by 1% volume growth. Beauty &amp;amp;amp; personal care segment recovered from 12% decline in Q1 to flat YoY sales in Q2. Foods segment saw strong 19% growth supported by price hike in tea segment. Home care segment declined 1.6% with 2.3% price cuts in fabric wash. The recovery in the business was led by complete normalisation of supply chain &amp;amp;amp; strong demand in health, hygiene &amp;amp;amp; nutrition space. However, demand for discretionary &amp;amp;amp; out of home products has still remained dismal. The health, hygiene &amp;amp;amp; nutrition products that constitute 80% of sales witnessed growth of 10% whereas discretionary &amp;amp;amp; out of home consumption products, which constitute 20%of sales saw a decline of 25%. Gross margin declined 145 bps largely on account of a sharp 70% increase in tea prices. Though the company has taken price hikes, it is not sufficient to pass on the entire cost increase. With 221 bps lower advertisement spends, HUL was able to maintain its operating margins at 25.1% (27 bps up). Net profit increased 8.7% to Rs 2009 crore. The slower growth in profitability is largely due to lower tax in base quarter. Outlook We believe H2FY21E would witness strong growth across segments with complete demand recovery in discretionary portfolio as well. The company has been able to leverage strong brands in hygiene (Lifebuoy, Domex, Vim, Surf Excel) space to drive growth. We believe the company would continue to witness strong double digit growth in the health, hygiene &amp;amp;amp; nutrition space. Further, margins improvement with consolidation of nutrition brands would drive earnings. We upgrade our recommendation from HOLD to BUY with a revised target price of Rs 2500/share.

496,2020-11-04 07:04:13+05:30,HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd.,HDFCLIFE,Hot Stocks | Here's why HDFC Life and Bajaj Finance are two buy calls for short term,"The technical setup suggests that bias is likely to remain in favour of bulls as Bank Nifty is continuously holding above the key levels of 25,200.","  Indian markets began this week on a positive note with Bank Nifty taking the lead with whopping gains of more than 7 percent so far this week, supported by a sharp surge in HDFC and Bajaj twins along with positive moves witnessed by Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and IndusInd Bank.  However, on the derivatives front, tug of war among bulls and bears kept the markets shaky on the back of mixed cues from the global front.  Nevertheless, volatility is likely to grip the market in the coming sessions as well as on the back of the US election results.  The technical setup, however, suggests that bias is likely to remain in favour of bulls as Bank Nifty is continuously holding above the key levels of 25,200.  Nifty also looks positive as long as it manages to hold above 11,500. On the higher side, a decisive move above 11,900 levels would add further follow up buying in the index which could take Nifty towards 12,150 to 12,200 levels in the coming sessions.  Here are two buy calls for the next 3-4 weeks:  HDFC Life Insurance Company | LTP: Rs 599 | Target price: Rs 644 | Stop loss: Rs 560 | Upside: 7.5%  For the last three months, the stock has been consistently moving lower in a downward sloping channel with the formation of the lower high and lower bottom patterns.  However, this week the stock has once again moved back above its short-term moving averages with a breakout above the falling trend line of the sloping channel.  The breakout can be seen with rising volumes and positive divergences on secondary oscillators.  Bajaj Finance | LTP: Rs 3,483.90 | Target price: Rs 3,835 | Stop loss: Rs 3,200 | Upside: 10%  After testing the levels of Rs 3,749 in early September, the stock slid sharply towards Rs 3,006 levels and thereafter it recovered and managed to surpass its 100-day exponential moving average on weekly charts.  On the daily charts as well, the stock is continuously holding above its 200-day exponential moving average which is placed at Rs 3,260 levels.  For the last five weeks, the has stock has been consolidating within the range of Rs 3,100-3,500.  However, this week we have observed a fresh breakout on the charts along with positive divergences on secondary oscillators.  The additional volumes with rising prices suggest the next upswing in the prices.

Deepak Kochhar, who is already in ED custody, may move court for bail. The quid pro quo part in the loan case was allegedly plotted by former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar, husband Deepak Kochhar, and Videocon promoter Venugopal Dhoot.","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed its first chargesheet on Wednesday in the ICICI Bank-Videocon loan case, involving Deepak Kochhar, businessman and husband of ICICI Bank&rsquo;s former CEO Chanda Kochhar, and Videocon promoter Venugopal Dhoot.  The ED has filed the chargesheet against 10 entities and three individuals. Videocon International Electronics Ltd (VIEL), Videocon Industries Ltd, Nu Power Renewables Ltd, Supreme Energy Pvt Ltd, Venugopal Dhoot, and Deepak and Chanda Kochhar are among them.  Deepak Kochhar, who is in the judicial custody of ED now, may move court for bail after this chargesheet.  What is the case?  The ED&rsquo;s probe under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in the ICICI Bank-Videocon loan case pertains to irregularities in the sanctioning of six loans worth Rs 1,875 crore by ICICI Bank to five firms of the Videocon Group between June 2009 and October 2011.  The bank had, on August 26, 2009, sanctioned a Rupee Term Loan of Rs 300 crore to VIEL in alleged contravention of the policy of the sanctioning committee, sources said.  On September 7, 2009, the loan was disbursed to VIEL, which it transferred to a group firm, Videocon Industries Limited (VIL), for financing the latter&rsquo;s capital expenditure requirements.  The next day, on September 8, in contravention of the terms of the loan sanctioned, VIL allegedly transferred Rs 64 crore through Supreme Energy, out of the loan proceeds, to Nupower Renewables, whose then managing director and CEO was Deepak Kochhar.  It was alleged that the transfer was part of a &lsquo;quid pro quo&rsquo; transaction between Chanda Kochhar and the Videocon Group via her husband&rsquo;s firm. Deepak and Chanda were questioned by the ED in the past and they had, along with the other case accused, denied all allegations. VIEL, SEPL, VIL, NRL, Deepak, Chanda and Videocon Group&rsquo;s Managing Director VN Dhoot were cited as accused in the case by ED.  ED arrests Deepak Kochhar  On September 8, the agency arrested Deepak Kochhar. ED had registered its case under the provisions of PMLA on the basis of a case registered by the CBI in January 2019 for cheating, conspiracy and misconduct by public servants under the Indian Penal Code and Prevention of Corruption Act.  The CBI had registered its case on the basis of the findings of the agency&rsquo;s year-long probe as part of its preliminary enquiry, a precursor to the registration of a regular case, which commenced in December 2017.  ED investigation showed that the residential property of Chanda Kochhar, worth Rs 5.25 crore in Mumbai, was bought in 1996 by Credential Finance Ltd, in which Videocon was having a substantial interest, along with Deepak and Chanda Kochhar. CFL defaulted the loan worth of Rs 4.7 crore, which it took from Videocon.  Subsequently, the ownership transferred to Quality Techno Advisors Pvt Ltd, and then its whole shareholding was acquired by Quality Advisors, a family trust of Deepak Kochhar, for just Rs 11 lakh.  Deepak Kochhar and Chanda Kochhar are facing probes from multiple agencies like SEBI, CBI and Serious Fraud Investigation Office. The CBI is yet to file a chargesheet in this case. The SFIO also has not filed its first complaint in the court yet.","Business, Chanda Kochhar, Deepak Kochhar, Enforcement Directorate, ICICI Bank-Videocon loan case, India, Venugopal Dhoot","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/tarun-sharma-6905/', 'name': 'Tarun Sharma'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/ed-files-first-chargesheetrs-1875-crore-icici-bank-videocon-loan-case_14457161.html

With labour availability and supply-chain-related issues now past, we expect a pick-up in execution in H2 FY21. Outlook NWC was elevated (26.7%), likely to improve with the pickup in execution. Considering the robust order backlog (~Rs3trn), sturdy balance sheet and no near competitor, we retain a Buy, with a revised TP of Rs1,311 (a sum-of-parts valuation on FY22e).

The Gautam Adani-led group plans to infuse Rs 35,780 crore in its airport business in the next five years, AEL Chief Financial Officer Jugeshinder Singh said.  &amp;quot;For Adani Enterprises for the next five years, the main focus area is airports, roads &hellip;the ballpark number over five years we expect &hellip;the capex is about Rs 50,000 crore,&amp;quot; Singh said in a post-earnings conference call.

About capex in road business, Singh said as a group point of view it is not very significant &amp;quot;but overall if we look at all in next five years it may be Rs 6,000 crore&amp;quot;.  In the roads sector, the company has signed five concession agreements with the NHAI under hybrid annuity model for construction of roads aggregating to over 200 kilometres. Two of the agreements were signed in July in Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. The project completion status of Bilaspur-Pathrapali project at Chhattisgarh is about 50 per cent, as per the company.

As guided by the management in its pre-quarterly update, jewellery sales have reached 98% of pre-Covid levels (on comparatively lower base, LTL: 90%). Including bullion sale of Rs 391 crore, revenue for jewellery division grew 7.2% YoY to Rs 3983 crore. Healthy demand for plain gold jewellery, gold coins arrested grammage de-growth in Q2FY21 that was at 31% (vs. de-growth of 81% in Q1FY21). Watches division recovery is sluggish with sales reaching 55% of pre-Covid level in Q2FY21 (September: 70%). Revenue for division de-grew 44% YoY to Rs 401 crore. Overall revenues fell 2% YoY to Rs 4553.0 crore. Due to unfavourable product mix (decline in share of studded ratio), reported EBITDA margins fell 430 bps YoY to 6.9% (underlying EBITDA margins: 7.7%, adjusted for ineffective hedges), with EBITDA down 40% YoY to Rs 313 crore. Provision of Rs 34 crore towards overdue margin money from a broker also impacted profitability. Going forward, overall demand trend for festive season in Q3FY21E appears positive with high single digit growth seen in first 10 days of festive period (but cannot be extrapolated for festive season). Outlook We maintain our revenue estimates but reduce our earnings estimates by 10%, 4% in FY21, FY22E, respectively, to factor in near term pressure on gross margins.

Blended ASPs were at Rs 51,412/unit, a rise of ~15% YoY (courtesy BS-VI transition). EBITDA margins at 13.7% were down 80 bps YoY.

Strong NII growth was driven by expansion in net interest margin (NIM), which jumped 7 bps YoY, 18 bps QoQ to 3.58%. Sequential 18 bps expansion in NIM was due to 3 bps from capital raise, 5 bps from lower interest reversals and 10 bps from better liquidity management. From Q1FY21, the bank is adding some amount in NII reserve. As a result, NIM was negatively impacted by 5 bps. Other income for the quarter increased 47% sequentially to Rs 3807 crore, which was on account of 67% QoQ rise in the fee income (insurance distribution surged). Cost to income ratio declined 90 bps QoQ to 38.0%. Part of this can be attributed to relatively lower business volumes as a result of less cost. PAT for the quarter increased 51.3% QoQ to Rs 1683 crore compared to a loss of Rs 112 crore. Outlook The management held its guidance to remain well above industry credit growth, though it is currently cautious on certain segments. It can see minimal loans going for restructuring (estimated 1.6% of loans). Strong capital position, healthy operating metrics and reasonable prudence in provisioning provides comfort for steady earnings visibility and return ratios reaching 0.9% RoA and ~9% RoE by FY22.

After the revision, EBITDA is expected to see 27% CAGR over FY20-23E. Driven by better margins and controlled capex, we expect FCF to turn positive to Rs66bn/Rs80bn in FY22/FY23E.

Overall loan growth was moderate at 11% yoy, including retail growth at 12% yoy/2% qoq. Though the bank has not given any numerical guidance, it expects overall growth trajectory to improve, led by retail and corporate growth largely in better-rated corporates. BB &amp;amp;amp; Below rated corporate pool increased to 2.3% of loans, but Axis expects the overall restructuring pool to be lower at 1.6% of loans, for which it has already made 20% provisioning (10% required). Overall SMA 1 book (30 DPD) was moderate at 2.3% of loans and collection efficiency is expected to reach 97% by Oct&rsquo;20-end. Outlook We like Axis&rsquo; aggressive stance to front-load provisions, which may depress RoA/RoE at 0.7%/7% in FY21E but should improve to 1.4%/13% by FY23E, aided by better growth, cost ratios and contained provisions.

The Royal Enfield Meteor 350 will be available in three editions &ndash; the Fireball, the Stellar and the Supernova.  All editions are fitted with alloy wheels and tubeless tyres as standard, giving riders convenience and peace of mind, especially on long journeys, the company said.

The Meteor 350 inherits its name from another Royal Enfield bike launched at the end of 1952, the Meteor, a touring motorcycle, the company said.  The new model has been designed and developed by designers and engineers based at Royal Enfield&rsquo;s two state-of-the-art technical centres, in Chennai and Bruntingthorpe, the UK.  It is powered by a 349 cc air-oil cooled single-cylinder engine that generates 20.2 bhp and 27 Nm of torque at 4,000 rpm.  &amp;quot;We wanted to build a motorcycle that could ensure a great cruising experience for new, as well as experienced riders.

In a clear manner it gives the rider all the information needed to make the right decision on the road,&rdquo; Lal said.  Royal Enfield CEO Vinod K Dasari said with the Meteor 350, the company intends to create a whole new way for people to engage with the brand and transform their purchase and ownership experience and it offers its customers a wide choice of personalisation options when they order their new motorcycles.  &amp;quot;While motorcycle personalisation has grown enormously over the last decade, the options available to create a personalized purchase experience are practically nonexistent.

Cipla on&nbsp;November 6 reported strong numbers with revenue rising 15 percent year on year to Rs 5,038 crore and net profit rising 41 percent to Rs 665 crore. The EBITDA stood at Rs 1,177 crore or 23.4 percent of revenue, rising by 266 basis points.  Cipla attributed this growth to robust performance across geographies, including in its key markets&nbsp;-- India, the US and South Africa.  India business grew 17 percent YoY to Rs 2,090 crore, well above the market growth of mid-single digits led by&nbsp;COVID portfolio, traction in chronic therapies, and a recovering hospital business partially offset by subdued seasonal triggers in acute therapies.  The firm's prescription business in India grew 14 percent YoY, as COVID-related products contributed about Rs 250 crore in Q2FY21.  Along with antiviral products for&nbsp;COVID such as Remdesivir, Favipiravir and Tocilizumab, Cipla's large basket of products that also have applications in the treatment of&nbsp;COVID have helped the company&nbsp;deliver market-beating performance.&nbsp;Its&nbsp;new&nbsp;products in the consumer space&nbsp;such as masks and sanitisers also boosted its&nbsp;bottomline.  Cipla MD and Global CEO Umang Vohra&nbsp;said at the company's earnings call on Friday that he expects the COVID sales to&nbsp;be at 30-35 percent of current sales level, despite the downward trend of COVID-19 cases in India.  &amp;quot;The more we understand now, there will be patterns of cases going up and down. It will be endemic,&amp;quot; Vohra said. The US business saw continued traction with launches such as Albuterol, Esomeprazole oral suspension and Migranal DHE. The company had launched dimethyl fumarate DR capsules in Q2FY20.  Cipla's US sales grew 5 percent YoY to $141 million in Q2FY21.  Vohra said while there is a huge competition in Albuterol meter dose inhaler (MDI), with seven competitors, it still remains a big opportunity.  &amp;quot;It is a 65 million units market, it's a big market,&amp;quot; Vohra said. Albuterol is used in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The company&nbsp;has the capacity to gain 20-25 percent of the market share, he added.  &amp;quot;We don't want to build it overnight, sustainability of supplies is more important. We do it in a quarter or two quarters,&amp;quot; Vohra pointed out.  Cipla has got approval for Albuterol in the US market in March. The withdrawal of Dublin-based Perrigo&nbsp;from the US market due to issues with its devices created a temporary shortage of 7-8 million units of the drug. The loss of one competitor&nbsp;has led to more pricing stability.  Cipla's&nbsp;facility in Goa had received a warning letter from the US Food and Drug Administration.&nbsp;The company said it will continue to engage with&nbsp;the US regulator&nbsp;to comprehensively address observations&nbsp;on the&nbsp;Goa unit.","Business, Companies, coronavirus, earnings","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/viswanath-pilla-6848/', 'name': 'Viswanath Pilla'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/cipla-expects-q2-growth-momentum-to-continuebackindia-business-albuterol-salesus_14468041.html

Even on a standstill asset classification, asset quality performance remained healthy as GNPA and NNPA were at 2.32% and 0.61%, respectively. Application for restructuring is minimal at ~5 bps of advances and is further expected to remain in low single digits at the end of December 2020. The bank witnessed lower delinquencies in Q2FY21 as account of Rs 399 crore slipped into NPA compared to Rs 1537 crore in the previous quarter.

Outlook Post balance sheet realignment, the management is geared to pedal growth ahead with focus on certain segments. Thus, we expect business momentum to pick from here on with operational parameters expected to show improvement. Improving collection efficiency and ample provision buffer is expected to arrest volatility in earnings but return ratios are seen improving gradually to 9.3% in FY22E.

There is a shift happening towards the SUV segment not only in India but globally also. In 2015 the share of SUVs in the domestic market used to be only 15 per cent but this year it is around 30 per cent,&amp;quot; Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Business Unit President Shailesh Chandra told PTI.  It is therefore imperative that whosoever has greater share of SUVs in the portfolio will have a greater pie, share of the market, he added.  &amp;quot;So we have taken note of that sometime back and accordingly targeted to have the widest SUV portfolio,&amp;quot; Chandra said.  Both Nexon and Harrier were doing great in the market in terms of sales numbers, he noted.  &amp;quot;Harrier has seen a significant jump from what we were doing last year on the back of the new automatic version we have come out with. Nexon did its highest ever sales last month and I hope it continues to do well,&amp;quot; Chandra said.  The company is now gearing up to roll out two new models in the portfolio.  &amp;quot;Going forward two additional models are going to come- Gravitas and Hornbill (codenames). Gravitas will be a seven-seater SUV while Hornbill will be a sub compact SUV so we will have four SUVs in our portfolio which would be the widest portfolio,&amp;quot; Chandra said.  Hornbill with a very aggressive position at one end and Gravitas at the other end, the company with four products would be well poised to tap the growing trend towards SUVs, he noted.  &amp;quot;It would help strengthen our market position and sales in the coming years,&amp;quot; Chandra said.  The company plans to launch the Gravitas during the last quarter of this fiscal. It is yet to fix a date for the Hornbill introduction.  Chandra said the company is focusing a lot on improving the sales and aftersales experience for its customers.  &amp;quot;For us it is one of the key areas on our agenda to transform. A whole bit of work has started with focus on how we can enhance the whole experience. The employees are being imparted soft skills apart from technical training,&amp;quot; he noted.  The company is also focusing on the issues with its dealer partners including their financial health and profitability, Chandra said.  &amp;quot;There have been instances of too many channel partners in one territory. There have been issues, so we are comprehensively going territory wise and seeing the health of the network. The second focus is reach and penetration, whether it meets our growth aspirations which we have for that specific territory,&amp;quot; he noted.  The company has over 800 dealerships for its passenger vehicle portfolio across the country.","Business, Companies, Tata Motors","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/tata-motors-aims-to-have-widest-portfoliosuvdomestic-market_14473701.html

544,2020-11-08 16:16:48+05:30,ITC Ltd.,ITC,ITC's 20% drop in Q2 net could be masking a strategic shift in its FMCG business,"Disaggregated numbers could hold pointers for analysts and investors on what could be coming, particularly in the foods and FMCG business.","Diversified business conglomerate ITC's nearly 20 percent drop in profits in second quarter-ended September 30, 2020 may well be masking a strategic shift towards consistently strengthening its fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) business, a segment that has otherwise remained largely ignored among investors and analysts.  The company's net profit during the quarter fell to Rs 3,232.4 crore during the quarter, compared to Rs 4,023.1 crore in the same period last year, meeting street estimates.  Revenue from the FMCG and 'Others' segment, however, clocked a 18.4 percent growth on a comparable basis (excluding lifestyle retailing business for which restructuring is underway, as also the education and stationery products business that has been seriously impacted by the closure of educational institutions).  A disaggregated analysis points towards a strategic tilt towards FMCG in recent years.  In the current financial year during the quarter-ended September 30, 2020, EBITDA for the FMCG segment grew 66 percent, while EBITDA margins for the segment expanded 300 basis points to 9.7 percent.  In the first half of the year, it launched over 70 new products in what appears to be part of an ambitious expansion plan identifying the FMCG segment as the company's main growth driver, with focus on new products, bold acquisitions and the high-octane marketing.  In May, it announced the decision to acquire Kolkata-based spice maker Sunrise Foods Pvt. Ltd (SFPL), seen as part of a wider strategy to fortify its position in the country's highly competitive FMCG market that is dominated by large corporations such as Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) and several local players in diverse regional geographies.  The earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes and amortisation (EBITDA) of the new FMCG businesses has more than doubled in three years&mdash; growing from from Rs 456 crore in 2017-18 to Rs 914 crores in 2019-20.  Over an eight-year period, segment EBIDTA for the FMCG businesses has multiplied from Rs 44 crore in 2012-13, a year before current Chairman Sanjiv Puri was elevated to president of the company&rsquo;s FMCG business, to Rs 914 crore in 2019-20, galloping at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 54 percent.  These may well be pointers for analysts and investors on what could be coming, particularly in the foods business with brands such as Aashirvaad (Rs 6,000 crore), Sunfeast (Rs 4,000 crore), Bingo (Rs 2,700 crore) and YiPPee (Rs 1,300 crore), achieving significant value and scale.  The restructuring of the lifestyle retailing business with the sale of the John Players brand are all measures to improve profitability of the FMCG segment.  There also appears to be a tactical shift in marketing initiatives with considerable focus on engagements with properties such as IPL, fitness and hygiene through Sunfeast, Bingo and Savlon.

The firm said its consolidated revenue was up 15 percent at Rs 5,038 crore.  Earlier on November 5, Mumbai-based pharmaceutical firm Lupin had confirmed that it faced cyberattack on its servers, however, maintained that it did not have any impact on its operations. The firm, in the meanwhile, is conducting a thorough assessment.  Also, Hyderabad-based drugmaker Dr Reddy&rsquo;s Laboratories Ltd's servers faced similar cyberattacks, following which it isolated all its data centre servers across the world temporarily as a preventive action. The attack was confirmed days after it received approval from Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) V.G.

There was a considerable increase in demand for essentials (atta, biscuits), instant food (noodles) &amp;amp;amp; entire hygiene portfolios (Savlon). The company expects Savlon sales (consumer spends) to reach Rs 1000 crore in FY21 (Rs 250 crore in FY20), which would become one of the largest brands in hygiene space despite clutter of new brands in category.

The bank has built significant provision buffers in terms of COVID-19 related (~1.3% of loans), standard assets and other provisions (~0.9%) and specific loan loss provisions (81.6% PCR), which should limit the need for incremental provisions.

The acquisition was done through its US unit Novelis.,"Hindalco Industries' consolidated net profit in the second quarter would have been much higher if not for the fire sale of one of its assets in the US. The company's consolidated net profit - despite coming back to black sequentially - fell 60 percent to Rs 387 crore, as compared to Rs 974 crore a year ago.  In the&nbsp;first quarter, the company had a net loss of Rs 709 crore.  At the same time, profit from continuing operations jumped 83 per cent YoY to Rs 1,785 crore. Consolidated revenue grew 5.32 per cent YoY to Rs 31,237 crore.  &amp;quot;We are disappointed by the treatment given by the Department of Justice to Hindalco and Novelis. We didn't get a fair value for the asset,&amp;quot; Hindalco Managing Director Satish Pai said, during a media call on November 10. &amp;quot;We tried everything...we got caught at a wrong time and a wrong place,&amp;quot; Pai added.  Hindalco announced the acquisition of US-based Aleris in 2018. The acquisition was done through its US unit Novelis.  What forced the aluminium major to sell the asset much lower than its fair value?  The deal  Hindalco needed to sell two assets to get the nod from the antitrust division of the US Department of Justice on the $2.8 billion Aleris deal. That was the agreement the two sides had signed in March.  This was after the Department had filed an antitrust lawsuit in September in 2019 that sought to block the deal, alleging that the acquisition would violate competition norms in the auto parts sector.  The auto industry is among the biggest clients for the aluminium major.  Apart from the unit in Lewisport, Hindalco also needed to sell Aleris the asset in Duffel. &amp;quot;We more or less got a fair value on the Duffel asset,&amp;quot; Pai said.  All indications were that even the Lewisport facility too will get a good price, matching its fair value of about $340 million. The unit got interest from up to 15 suitors.  But then, COVID-19 struck.  Most of the suitors walked out. Only ones who stayed back were the private equity guys, how understood the value in buying an asset from a distressed owner. And it was finally American Industrial Partners, a private equity investment firm, that got the asset for $170 million, half the fair value.  &amp;quot;They took advantage of the situation,&amp;quot; said Pai.  Couldn't Hindalco ask for more time?  The company did. It had initially got 30 days, and then 90 more days to strike a deal.  But when things worsened during COVID-19, the company approached the Department for more time. &amp;quot;We tried everything to get more time. But they pushed us hard to close it,&amp;quot; said Pai.  One reason why the Department was rushing was the change in administration with the President-elect Joe Biden expected to take over at the beginning of 2021.  Does that sour the Aleris deal?  Not really, says Pai. In fact, adds the Managing Director, the savings from synergy has increased.  Earlier the company had expected annual synergy benefits to be $150 million a year. &amp;quot;Half of it was to come from traditional segments, including from admin and supply chain. The rest would come from the synergy of the Chinese operations,&amp;quot; said Pai.  The company now expects the savings from traditional synergy items to increase to $120 million. &amp;quot;We have already achieved a run rate of $38 million at the end of the second quarter,&amp;quot; said Pai. &amp;quot;Now that we have been running Aleris for two years, and have studied the asset in more detail, we see more benefits,&amp;quot; he added.  The other COVID-19 impact  The pandemic has also impacted Hindalco's deal in Europe, where the Aleris unit had to sell its plant in Duffel, Belgium.  Though Novelis had struck a deal with Alvance, the aluminium unit of Liberty Steel Group that is led by Sanjeev Gupta, now it is stuck.  While the deal was struck for Euros 310 million and Alvance has paid Euros 210 million, the rest of the amount is yet to be transferred. Pai hinted that Alvance wants to negotiate for the rest of the amount as it believes the economic circumstances have changed because of COVID-19.  &amp;quot;We believe that is a fair price and they have signed an agreement and will have to pay,&amp;quot; said Pai. The company has now gone for an arbitration regarding the payment of the remaining Euros 100 million.  Bright outlook  Pai said that the company is seeing robust demand from its clients in building and construction, and auto, in India. Internationally too, demand has come back strong from customers in can and auto segments. The only worry is regarding the aerospace industry that is still struggling to cope up with the pandemic.  On India, the top executive said that the third and fourth quarters should see even better demand. &amp;quot;If one goes by the RBI's outlook, the country is looking at a 10 percent growth in GDP in the next financial year. If that has to happen, then demand has to start up picking up,&amp;quot; he said.  With the domestic demand picking up, company's exports have come down. From 80 percent during the lockdown, exports are now at 54 percent of the total output.","Business, Companies, Hindalco Industries","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/why-was-hindalco-industries-forced-to-sellus-asset-below-fair-value-leading-todentq2-net-profit_14482881.html
567,2020-11-10 16:58:02+05:30,Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd.,DRREDDY,Why Lupin&rsquo;s Solosec is a cautionary tale for the much-hyped speciality drug business,"The company&rsquo;s speciality business has contracted 50 percent, as Covid continues to take a toll and limits its ability to promote Solosec to prescribing doctors ","Drug maker&nbsp;Lupin,&nbsp;which had pinned its hopes on flagship speciality drug Solosec driving sales growth in the US market, finds those plans in some disarray due to the sharp drop in prescriptions for acute medicines and the continued impact of Covid-19 in that market.  Lupin has scaled down the operations of its speciality business focussed on women&rsquo;s health. The company reduced its front-end salesforce by over 120 people to 45 in June and is focussing more on a digital push to promote the drug. To limit cash burn, Lupin reduced patient co-pays coupons, though this also means lower sales.  &ldquo;The last two quarters have been quite a dynamic situation on the (speciality) business. One, because of Covid, the business is down 50 percent, and then our restructuring certainly had an impact on share of voice,&rdquo; said Vinita Gupta, Lupin CEO, during the company&rsquo;s recent earnings calls.  &ldquo;Our scripts (prescriptions) are relatively flat; revenues are relatively flat. Obviously, that&rsquo;s not what we are satisfied with,&rdquo; Gupta added.  Analysts say weekly prescriptions of Solosec before the onset of Covid-19 stood at more than 2,000 patients, with 10 percent quarter-on-quarter growth. The product contributed $3-5 million in revenues.   Huge bet Solosec, which is used to treat bacterial vaginosis &mdash; the most common vaginal infection among women of childbearing age &mdash; became Lupin&rsquo;s asset after it acquired Symbiomix Therapeutics by paying $150 million in October 2017 to expand the women&rsquo;s health segment.   The drug was approved by the USFDA in September 2017, with a 10-year marketing exclusivity. Lupin earlier said it will be spending $45-50 million on an annual basis on promotions, the highest ever by the Mumbai-based drugmaker on any single drug so far. Lupin was earlier expecting the drug to break even by FY22.   To be sure, Solosec is a promising product with a high cure rate, few side effects and convenient (patients need just a single dose). Despite these advantages the uptake has been slow. In addition, it faces stiff competition from a cheaper generic antibiotic, Metronidazole, which continues to dominate the market.   But it is Covid-19 that has made things difficult for the company.  Gupta said Lupin&rsquo;s sales teams were able to make only 35 percent of their face to face calls with gynaecologists and obstetricians in the US who write prescriptions.  For a product that is very promotion-sensitive, this doesn&rsquo;t augur well.  But Gupta still believes Solosec will turn the corner during the first half of 2021, as the Lupin team works on ramping up scripts and revenues. She hopes the slowdown of Covid-19 and the USFDA approving a new indication for Solosec, to treat Trichomoniasis or trich in women, will be key drivers for the turnaround.   Cautionary tale But others aren&rsquo;t too excited about speciality drugs or prescription drugs that are based on incremental innovation such as repurposing or a novel formulation or requiring special handling.   Speciality drugs are approved using a different pathway, called the 505(b)(2) new drug application, with a limited period of exclusivity. They see speciality drugs mitigating the rapid price erosion and commoditisation of plain vanilla generic drugs in the US.  The advantages end there. Companies have to build marketing and sales machinery to build brands, get the drug formularies to add the drug, and payers to back it. All this is very new for Indian drug companies, who are known for selling generic drugs.   Dr Reddy&rsquo;s,&nbsp;for instance, in a major shift in strategy, sold or out-licensed most of its speciality or proprietary portfolio last year, and decided to refocus on the generics business.   Click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to read about&nbsp;Dr Reddy&rsquo;s Labs&rsquo; reasons for scaling down its speciality business   Cipla,&nbsp;too, was talking about expanding into the speciality segment through acquisitions, but now says it is focussed on the generics business.   Cipla acquired Nasdaq-listed speciality business firm Avenue Therapeutics in 2018 for up to $215 million to access specialty drug Tramadol, which is delivered intravenously (IV) to manage post-operative pain.   &ldquo;We are focussed on generics. The opportunity in the generic business is huge. The US generics business has been seeing healthy tailwinds, be it pipeline, bet it pace of approval, be it pricing,&rdquo; said Kedar Upadhye, Cipla&rsquo;s Global Chief Financial Officer.   &ldquo;There are several issues about speciality; it is very expensive, just from the point of investment and capital requirement; and it has a long gestation &mdash; it takes a lot of time to break even and the capability required for go-to-market, portfolio is very high,&rdquo; he said.   &ldquo;One has to be careful, if you get into it then you should go with a long horizon. And it&rsquo;s a risky choice, when you have enough headroom in generics business,&rdquo; he added.   Sun Pharma, which has invested over $1 billion in building a portfolio of speciality assets, however, remains committed despite the Covid headwinds.","$2 trillion coronavirus bill, Business, Companies","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/viswanath-pilla-6848/', 'name': 'Viswanath Pilla'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/why-lupinÃ¢ÂÂs-solosec-iscautionary-tale-formuch-hyped-speciality-drug-business_14483301.html
568,2020-11-11 07:24:01+05:30,SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd.,SBILIFE,"Hot Stocks | Can buy LIC Housing Finance, Delta Corp and SBI Life for short term","On the technical front, 12,750 and 29,500 would act as an immediate hurdle for Nifty and Bank Nifty, respectively.","  Indian markets closed at record high on November 10 on the back of strong global cues.  So far, Nifty has surged more than 8 percent this month while Bank Nifty has gained nearly 19 percent as uncertainty over the US elections ended along with development in the COVID vaccine.  Banking and financial stocks surged sharply with Bajaj and HDFC twins among top gainers.  On the derivatives front, the rally was supported by short-covering, done by call writers at 12,400 and 12,500 strikes.  Furthermore, put writers added hefty open interest at 12,400 strikes and seen shifting at higher bands.  On the technical front, 12,750 and 29,500 would act as an immediate hurdle for Nifty and Bank Nifty, respectively.  However, secondary oscillators suggest that the market is a bit overheated now and traders should expect volatility in the coming sessions.  On the downside, 12,400 would act as strong support for Nifty with bias likely to remain in favour of bulls.  We advise traders to use any dip to create fresh longs. For Bank Nifty, the 28,000-27,500 zone is a strong support area.  Here are three buy calls for the next 2-3 weeks:  LIC Housing Finance | LTP: Rs 323.50 | Target price: Rs 353 | Stop loss: Rs 293 | Upside: 9%  For the last nearly ten weeks, the stock has been consolidating in a broader range of Rs 280-320 along with consistent buying around support levels.  On the daily charts, the stock is holding well above its short and long-term moving averages.  This week, the stock has managed to give a price volume breakout above its 200-days exponential moving average on the daily charts and also succeeded to close above the key resistance level of Rs 320 after a prolonged consolidation.  Delta Corp | LTP: Rs 119.50 | Target price: Rs 132 | Stop loss: Rs 108 | Upside: 10%  The stock has given a sharp rally from Rs 85 to Rs 115 in August 2020 and after that, it went into consolidation as prices were seen fluctuating in the range of Rs 100 to Rs 120 levels.  This week, the stock has managed to give consolidation breakout above the 200-day exponential moving average on a daily timeframe and also managed to close above it.  The positive divergences on secondary oscillators suggest further up-move in the prices as the breakout is well supported by additionally higher volumes.  SBI Life Insurance Company | LTP: Rs 831 | Target price: Rs 902 | Stop loss: Rs 775 | Upside: 9%  For the last three months, the stock has been consistently moving lower in a downward sloping channel with the formation of the lower high and lower bottom patterns.  However, this week the stock has once again moved back above its short-term moving averages with a breakout above the falling trend line of the sloping channel.  The breakout can be seen with rising volumes and positive divergences on secondary oscillators.

Parekh noted that its investments are making the company &amp;quot;more relevant&amp;quot; for clients. He expressed confidence that given the market dynamics and the way it has positioned itself, Infosys will continue with its growth journey.  &amp;quot;We have essentially four growth drivers that are helping us&hellip; The first is digital, everything is shifting to digital today, 47 per cent of our business is digital. It was growing at 25 per cent in the last quarter. Second is large deals, our momentum is very strong,&amp;quot; he said.  According to him, it is a focused plan to work with existing clients and work with what they want to do next, what is relevant for them and &amp;quot;how we can help them in navigating the next, by then, becoming deeper in the relationship with those clients&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;We have some statistics, where our accounts greater than USD 100 million has steadily expanded because of this attention to our clients,&amp;quot; he said. Further, Parekh said the company is also focussing its attention on new accounts and working with new clients.  &amp;quot;Our leadership team, I believe, is working extremely well, it's been stable for the last three years. The team is working collaboratively&hellip; we're making sure that we are cohesive and we have a common focus in serving our clients, and focusing into all aspects within the company,&amp;quot; he said. He added that the company has made strategic bets in growth drivers like investments in digital in automation.  &amp;quot;We've also got a clear set of margin drivers, which are in place, at which we are strategically executing on which I believe will help us sustain and over time in the medium term, expand our margins,&amp;quot; he said.","Business, Infosys","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/infosys-well-positioned-to-continue-its-growth-ceo-salil-parekh_14489121.html

Most OOH consumption categories were impacted in 2Q, and the cigarettes category was not left out. Cigarette net revenue/vol/EBIT clocked -14/-12/-16% growth as compared to our expectation of -8/-10/-8% YoY. FMCG revenue growth was at 15% (HSIE 12.5%), better than Nestle/Britannia (10/11% YoY). EBIT/EBITDA margin was at 6.7/9.7% (HSIE 3.6/7%). Localised lockdowns impacted the recovery in August to mid-Sep for cigarettes, which was witnessed in JuneJuly. Key markets like Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu were weak with COVID impact. Cigarette mix was also unfavourable and impacted margin. Volume recovery at the end of the quarter is a positive sign. FMCG continues to shine, and ITC is capitalising the high demand for health, hygiene and packaged food products. Outlook We cut our EPS estimate for FY21 by 3% while maintaining it for FY22/FY23. We value ITC on SoTP and maintain target price at Rs 236 (implied P/E of 18x P/E Sep-22E EPS). Maintain BUY.

The Cigarette business posted ~3.9% YoY de-growth, vs est of 5% decline. Our analysis suggests 10%+ volume decline in cigarette business. A 880bps decline in margin in the Cigarette business indicates that the product mix was unfavorable and economy brand contribution must have increased during the quarter. Significant increase in duty has resulted in widening of price gap between ITC and smuggled cigarettes. We believe that this would continue to pressurize volume growth going ahead. FMCG business exhibited strong performance with 15.4% revenue increase and 390bps margin expansion. We have upward revised our FY21E and FY22E EPS estimates to Rs 11.0 (+3.9%) and Rs 12.7 (+5.7%) to factor in Q2 performance and introduced FY23E EPS at Rs 13.6.

582,2020-11-12 14:56:41+05:30,HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd.,HDFCLIFE,Samvat 2077 | Samco Securities suggests these 10 stocks for rocket portfolio,"While the road ahead looks brighter, analysts and brokerages advise being prudent while picking stocks.","The Indian equity market has witnessed strong gains in Samvat 2076 and Samvat 2077 now looks much brighter, thanks to signs of economic recovery and encouraging reports of the COVID-19 vaccine.  Experts point out that growth is likely to come back strongly looking at the high-frequency indicators.  On the front of the COVID-19 vaccine, media reports suggest there are some ten COVID vaccine candidates in phase 3 trials, and vaccination can be expected by early 2021.  While the road ahead looks brighter, analysts and brokerages advise being prudent while picking stocks.  Here are 10 stocks suggested by brokerage firm Samco Securities for Samvat 2077. Take a look:  HDFC Life Insurance  HDFC Life is a strong contender in the life insurance space and even after a weak Q1 performance with a 30 percent decline in premiums, HDFC Life surpassed its peers with a stellar 21 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in new premiums in the second quarter.  As a front-runner in the protection segment through its Banca channel, HDFC Life is efficiently leveraging its first-mover advantage.  Favorable product mix and repricing of protection products have also aided in margin expansion. Amidst the pandemic, a 25-26 percent margin guidance for FY21 by the management seems achievable, hence HDFC Life could be a strong compounding story.  Moreover, its moat lies in the powerful brand, qualified management, strong return and persistency ratios, improved solvency ratio and higher operating ROEV.  Pidilite Industries  Pidilite Industries is the leader in the domestic market for adhesives, sealants and construction chemicals.  Its product portfolio has high recall among consumers which enables a strong market leadership and demand for brands such as Fevicol, Dr.Fixit and Fevikwik.  A recent acquisition of the maker of Araldite is further expected to strengthen its leadership in the adhesive space. The huge scope of growth from the construction chemicals industry builds confidence in Pidilite's future outlook.  A unique moat enables it to deliver robust financial performance with 18 percent CAGR growth in PAT over 5 years and rich cash flow generation with OCF at Rs 1,280 crore and FCF at Rs 827 crore seen in FY20.  Overall, a well-rounded company with an identifiable brand presence and robust financials make Pidilite Industries a wealth generator for investors.  Bharat Rasayan  When most industries were impacted due to lockdowns, a few agri-businesses managed to escape. Bharat Rasayan, a leading maker of technical-grade pesticides in India, is one of them.  As farming-related activities continued, demand for pesticides continued to remain strong which allowed the company to maintain robust operating margins in the range of 18-23 percent.  It has also delivered an exemplary revenue CAGR of 23 percent over the past 5 years with strong cash flow generation.  Bharat Rasayan is expected to grow at the current pace given the growing market opportunity and superior R&amp;amp;amp;D capabilities facilitating innovation and high margin product development.  Even amidst a challenging scenario, it has a strong product portfolio, vast distribution network and brand equity which enable steady performance.  All these factors coupled with attractive valuations enable strong returns to shareholders.  Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro  The lockdown impacted its core engineering business but the IT business flourished as digitization and cloud-adaptation became the norm for companies globally, resulting in strong financial performance from this segment.  What guides L&amp;amp;amp;T's future is its magnificent order book including a Rs 24,985 crore deal for developing a 237km-line for Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train with long-term revenue prospects.  The stock has taken quite the battering which makes it attractive from a valuation perspective and very limited scope for further downside.  Attractive margins, stable free cashflows, robust order book, recovery in engineering business and large opportunities from the defence segment make L&amp;amp;amp;T a compelling addition to the portfolio.  Bharti Airtel  In the telecom sector's largely duopoly environment, Bharti is well-positioned to serve the premium end of the subscriber base and continues to gain market share in top-end subscribers, driving superior ARPUs.  The recently concluded fundraising of Rs 550 crore via QIP/rights issue and a stake sale of the Africa business aided in making its balance sheet resilient to stressful times.  Bharti can also consider monetizing its 53.51 percent stake in Bharti Infratel in the future to invest in 5G and future technologies.  With a sound business model of a partnership approach rather than an ownership approach, Bharti can leverage its growing partner ecosystem to build digital assets and compete against the mighty Reliance Jio.  With rising ARPUs, robust EBITDA performance, contained debt levels, a large asset base, Bharti seems to be in a sweet spot with a strong growth outlook from an investment perspective.  Kotak Mahindra Bank  This bank has always maintained a very conservative stance and its actions such as providing for nearly 177 percent of its total net NPA reflect the same conservative approach which seems adequate amidst a contracting economy.  Going forward, the management aims to focus on its asset engine for growth while maintaining a resilient capital position.  Not only does Kotak have robust NIMs, comfortable asset quality and a top-notch liability franchise, it also has adequate margin levers. RBI's ruling on the restructuring of loans and deferment in reporting NPLs post-August will surely delay the true asset deterioration but even then Kotak seems to have an upper hand in managing its assets well with prudent risk management.  It seems to be hitting all the right nerves to be regarded as a strong contender to ride the COVID wave.  HDFC  This NBFC mammoth has a long-standing track record of operations, adequate capitalisation levels, strong resource raising ability, stringent underwriting standards and top-notch risk management procedures.  Despite facing a hard hit in its retail lending business due to national lockdowns, HDFC has efficiently managed to bring about recovery in its numbers this quarter.  In fact, the disbursements in October 2020 were the second-highest in HDFC's history.  The environment down the road seems conducive for the housing finance sector given the low-interest rates, softer property prices, reduction in stamp duty in certain states and inherent strong demand for home loans and HDFC seems to be in a comfortable liquidity position to benefit from these macros. It is undoubtedly a strong brand to hold in an investor's portfolio.  Dixon Technologies  Dixon Tech is India's largest electronic manufacturing player and is currently witnessing a confluence of rising demand, import substitution and booster in the form of the PLI Scheme by the Government.  Under the scheme, the company will get an incentive of 4 percent to 6 percent on incremental sales of goods manufactured in the country. The management also expects an eight-fold jump in its mobile revenues in FY22.  Dixon is currently in the growth phase and undergoing an aggressive scale-up across product segments. This along with a backward integration model, fungible capacities and a focused approach will drive its growth going ahead.  Being the only listed EMS player in the organized space, Dixon is richly valued however with a strong order book and a leaner working capital cycle, growth is expected to meet expectations in the upcoming quarters. Hence, Dixon can be looked at from a portfolio perspective.  Marico  Marico is a robust FMCG player and one of the major beneficiaries of the unprecedented rise in the in-home consumption of products during the first half of FY21.  With double-digit growth in its India business in Q2 and strong momentum in its Parachute, Saffola and other major brands, the company is on its path to deliver strong growth, especially from rising rural demand.  On an international front, its Bangladesh business is clocking hefty volumes and the company also plans to replicate the same strategy in Vietnam.  In the medium-term, Marico aims to deliver a mix of healthy top and bottom-line growth with 19-20 percent operating margins.  All these factors bode well for shareholders who have been receiving an average ROE of 35 percent in the past 5 years and a dividend yield of 1.8 percent.  Considering all the tailwinds, Marico seems like a good fit from an investment perspective.  Ambuja Cements  Ambuja combined with ACC and the Holcim group is the second-largest cement player in India with an individual capacity of 29.7 MT.  It has a stronghold in the North and Central markets and a respectable presence in the eastern markets which was the least impacted by the pandemic.  Compared to ACC and Ultratech, Ambuja fared better in its Q2 realization levels. Moreover, the company has also undergone stringent cost-cutting measures to deliver efficient operational performance.  Its next leg of growth consists of adding new capacities at Marwar and expansion in the central region.  With the infra boost by the government, Ambuja seems to be well-placed to ramp-up a few orders and boost sales.  To summarize, Ambuja is a cheaply valued stock trading at a one-year forward EV/EBITDA of 7 times with strong potential to benefit from the upcoming infra boom in India.

Lower than expected volumes and realisations in AL operations led the miss in earnings. Rise in AL prices (+6% in Oct'20 over Q2FY21 average) and flattish cost of production (CoP) would support earnings in H2. Led by better visibility on profitability of legacy Novelis ops and increased synergies in Aleris, Novelis increased guidance on sustainable EBITDA margin to US$480-500/t from USD450-475/t. Admittedly, divestment of Aleris&rsquo; Lewis port disappointed us due to low valuations. We believe that it would be make up by strong profitability, enhanced synergies and tight cost control. In domestic operations (with share reducing to 30% in consolidated EBITDA), quarterly EBITDA run-rate would improve to Rs14.5bn (v/s12.5bn last year) on the back of strong LME and measured cost increase.

The beat was led by strong performance in FES. EBIT margins for FES was recorded at 24.4% (+5% YoY) led by operating leverage and cost controls. In 2QFY21, with focus on prudent capital allocation, M&amp;amp;amp;M exited Gipps Aerospace business (Aircraft manufacturing division). Also it was able to turn around key global FES subs to EBIT positive (2Q contribution postive at Rs30m v/s loss of Rs560m YoY). We are positive on MM as 1) better rural sentiments should help drive FES and auto segments over FY21-23 and 2) continued focus on exiting non core/loss making business bode well for re-rating. We increase FY21/22/23 EPS by 16%/4%/1% and built in EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 12.6%/19% over FY21- 23E.  Outlook We maintain BUY with revised SoTP based price target of Rs728 (v/s Rs703).

Overall business recovery has set in across segments, although cigarettes, Hotels and Leaf tobacco will have a delayed recovery. We believe strong sales momentum in Foods, Hygiene and success in the frozen snacks and Vegetables is a long term positive given that ITC&rsquo;s margins have started reflecting impact of cost control and scale. We believe ITC would be one of the key beneficiary of an uptick in consumer demand given the depth and width of its portfolio, fast paced launches and innovations.

Outlook We expect sales, adjusted PAT to grow at 8%, 36.2% CAGR, respectively, in FY20-23E. Continued demand traction for tractor segment along with ongoing focus on responsible capital allocation helps us maintain our constructive stance on M&amp;amp;amp;M.

The Finance Minister has allocated Rs 6,322 crore for this segment of the steel industry.  &amp;quot;We welcome the move of Government of India in extending PLI scheme to speciality steel products. This will enable the steel industry to attract fresh investment and state of the art technology that would make India self-reliant in producing value-added speciality steel products&amp;quot; Seshagiri Rao, Joint MD, JSW Steel &amp;amp;amp; Group CFO, said in a statement.  Dilip Oommen, CEO of ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India, tweeted:  &amp;quot;#PLIscheme is WTO compliant and will help in realising the dream of India becoming a manufacturing hub of the world. Heartening to see Speciality Steel included in the key sectors selected.&amp;quot;  But, off the record, industry executives await for granular details.  &amp;quot;One needs to know the definition of specialty steel that the government has considered. What all grades of steel will be included?&amp;quot; asks a senior executive.  Traditionally, specialty steel included the high-grade ones used by automakers or electrical steel that&nbsp;are needed to make transformers and generators.  Many of the Indian companies, including Tata Steel, JSW Steel and AM/NS, already make some these specialised steel products. Also, L&amp;amp;amp;T Special Steels &amp;amp;amp; Heavy Forgings and Kalyani Carpenter Special Steels Ltd, are among other players.  &amp;quot;But some of the automakers, especially the multinational ones, prefer to source steel from companies of their own countries,&amp;quot; says a senior executive from a private steel maker.  Otherwise too, adds another executive, only 2 percent of the specialised steel used in the auto sector, is at present imported.  Even in electrical steel, it is only some of the niche products that are imported. &amp;quot;Only two-three companies in the world make these steel. They will never transfer their know-how. Anyways, there is not much demand for these steel products in India to warrant a local manufacturing base,&amp;quot; said one of the executive quoted above.  To be sure, steel executives are awaiting further details on the scheme to come from the government, before taking a decision.","Business, Companies","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/pli-scheme-steel-industry-welcomes-inclusionspecialty-steel-butfew-questions-remain_14492641.html

All the positive news flow with respect to US Elections and second-quarter results are over and we do not have any major news flow to drive the markets from the current levels.  Bank Nifty has also moved up 40 percent since the September expiry lows and multiple resistance near 28,800-29,200 levels would cap the upside.  We expect the markets to consolidate and it may turn weak from here if any negative news flow or global market volatility emerges.  The outperformance of mid and small-caps could continue and we remain positive on the Midcap100 index to test 18,500 levels.  Pharma could remain an outperformer as it has witnessed double bottom near 11,000 levels, witnessing a sharp up-move.  Here is one buy and two sell calls for the next 2-3 weeks:  Lupin | Buy | LTP: Rs 897.40 | Target price: Rs 1,030 | Stop loss: Rs 825 | Upside: 15%  The stock has bounced from its long-term 200-day average after a sharp decline from the recent high of Rs 1,125.  RSI has moved higher from its lower range and may resume its uptrend with positive price action.  In case of a major decline, multi-month support at Rs 830-840 should act as strong support for the stock.  Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra (M&amp;amp;amp;M) | Sell | LTP: Rs 634.05 | Target price: Rs 575 | Stop loss: Rs 670 | Downside: 9%  The stock has failed to cross its 200-week average placed at Rs 665 over the last 2 months and witnessed reversal.  The stock&rsquo;s key technical indicators on the near-term timeframe chart are negatively poised which could drag the stock towards Rs 575. Any jump above Rs 670 will negate a down-move in the stock.  Axis Bank | Sell | LTP: Rs 598.10 | Target price: Rs 540 | Stop loss: Rs 635 | Downside: 10%  The stock has witnessed a sharp up-move post the breakout of its 200-day average and has closed in a Doji candle near the top of the range.  Daily RSI has also reversed downwards indicating a reversal and at 80 levels it indicates a limited upside from the current levels.  On the higher side, multiple resistance is placed at Rs 625-635, being the long-term monthly averages.

It further highlighted the ambition to eventually have 33% of the workforce operating flexibly/remotely, which should help lower capex and D&amp;amp;amp;A expenses. At the board level, the Infosys chairman reiterated the board's confidence in the management and expressed the willingness to retain their position as long as necessary. This should mitigate any remnant concern related to the management and board's stability. Infosys' outlook for a large wave of technological investment is in line with our expectation. This should lead to a strong demand outlook for the IT Services industry in the medium term. Outlook Infosys should narrow the divergence in its valuation with TCS to 10%. On our estimates, the stock is currently trading at 21x FY22 EPS. We value the stock at 25x FY22E EPS (10% discount to TCS). Reiterate Buy.

600,2020-11-13 19:50:14+05:30,Tata Steel Ltd.,TATASTEEL,Tata Steel confirms talks with Sweden's SSAB to sell Dutch unit,Proceeds from the sale will be used to lower the debt on Tata Steel's books,"Tata Steel has confirmed that it's in talks with Sweden's SSAB to sell its unit in the Netherlands, the flagship of its operations in Europe.  This is a fresh attempt from India's largest steelmaker to find a solution to its troubles in Europe, more than a year after a merger with Germany's thyssenkrupp was blocked by European Commission.  The company said it has &amp;quot;commenced discussions with the Supervisory Board and Board of Management of Tata Steel Netherlands and the process will move to the next stage including due diligence and stakeholders&rsquo; consultations.&amp;quot; The Netherlands unit has an annual capacity of 7.5 million tonne&nbsp;and has 10,000 employees.  Proceeds from the sale will be used to lower the debt on the company's books. Tata Steel Europe has a debt of 1.7 billion Euros.  Simultaneously, the company has also begun the process of separating Tata Steel Netherlands and Tata Steel UK, and &amp;quot;will pursue separate strategic paths for the Netherlands and the UK business in the future&amp;quot;, it said. The company has been in talks with the UK government for financial aid to shore up its operations in the country.  &amp;quot;There will be stages in this transaction, and will close it in six to nine months,&amp;quot; Executive Director and CFO Koushik Chatterjee, said during an analyst call on November 13.  CEO and Managing Director TV Narendran added that the company is &amp;quot;not expecting competition commission issues&amp;quot; like in its earlier proposed merger with Germany's thyssenkrupp.  The merger with thyseenkrupp was blocked by the European Commission in 2019, and turned out to be a big setback for Tata Steel in its attempt to find a solution to the European puzzle. Since its 2006 acquisition of Corus, which was later renamed Tata Steel Europe, the operations have for most of the years incurred losses and were dependent on the Indian parent to stay afloat.  The Commission had said that the merged entity, which would have been the second largest in Europe after ArcelorMittal, would have hurt competition in some of the segments, including&nbsp; packaging steel, auto-grade steel and electrical steel.  The company is now hoping that the deal with SSAB will have a better fate with the Commission. Narendran said that the merged entity, that of Tata&nbsp; Steel Netherlands and SSAB, won't have a significant presence in packaging or auto steel.  SSAB is known for making steel that is used in making machinery and equipment that have application in mining, earth moving and construction segments.  What happens to Tata Steel UK?  The big question is now on the future of the UK operations, which have been the biggest drag on the company. Overall in Europe, about 70 to 80 percent of the EBITDA comes from the Dutch unit.  The UK operations, which churn out about 5 million tons of steel a year, have been a subject of much debate and consternation, as was again seen during the analyst call on Friday, as many analysts repeatedly asked about the future of the unit.  Narendran reiterated that the focus of the company is make the UK operations self-sustainable and not dependent on cash injections from the Indian parent. &amp;quot;In the last six months, which have been very challenging, the UK operations have not needed help,&amp;quot; he said.  &amp;amp;nbsp;","Business, Companies, India, Tata Steel","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/tata-steel-confirms-talkssweden39s-ssab-to-sell-dutch-unit_14497041.html

Infosys, which counts the US as its biggest market, said it is still early to comment on the approach the new US administration could take towards work visas but it expects to continue benefiting from its ongoing localisation efforts.  &amp;quot;We continue to see challenges to mobility of talent. New proposed immigration regulations in USA could impact onsite wage costs, granting of visas, tenure of visas, and overall costs of compliance.  &amp;quot;Our localisation programme across USA, Europe and Australia, launched three years ago, mitigates many of these,&amp;quot; Infosys Chief Operating Officer Pravin Rao said at a recent analyst meet.  He added that Infosys has eight innovation hubs across the US and the EU, nine global Digital Studios (including a 5G lab in Melbourne) and seven global cyber defense centres.  &amp;quot;We are close to 63 percent visa-independent in the US and over 50 percent in Europe and ANZ. We have been intensely focused on creating jobs in the US for the past three years,&amp;quot; he noted.  In September, the Bengaluru-based firm had said it plans to hire 12,000 American workers over the next two years, taking its hiring commitment in the country to 25,000 over five years.  Industry watchers say while IT companies have been ramping up their presence in the US and other markets, and hiring locals over the past few years to overcome visa-related challenges.  North America is the largest market for Infosys, accounting for 60.7 percent of its revenue, followed by Europe (24.3 percent), rest of the world (12 percent) and India (3 percent), as on September 30, 2020. Infosys had clocked 8.5 percent year-on-year rise in revenue to Rs 24,570 crore in the September 2020 quarter.  Infosys had 2,40,208 employees at the end of the said quarter. It does not provide a region-specific break-up of the headcount.  Rao said that through academia partnerships with institutes like Purdue, Trinity and RISD, the company has trained a large number of employees as well, and is leveraging the training and reskilling programmes that it has built with partners.  &amp;quot;We recently launched reskill and restart platform, which will play a crucial role in hiring local talent. We will bring a specific focus on building pathways for those that have been impacted by the economic downturn,&amp;quot; he said adding that Infosys is also expanding its presence in nearshore locations like Mexico and Canada.  Asked if Infosys will rethink its strategy as the approach of the president-elect on the visa issue appears to be more liberal, Rao said it is still early days to comment.  &amp;quot;It is early days to see what the approach of the new regime is towards visa and by and large many of the things we saw during the Trump regime had bipartisan support as well.  &amp;quot;We may see some changes from the Trump regime, but it will not go back to the old pre-Trump days,&amp;quot; he added.  He added that from a strategic perspective, Infosys'' approach of localisation is &amp;quot;probably the right one&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;This is what we anticipated about three years back and we are seeing huge success and we have benefited from it and it is likely to continue,&amp;quot; Rao said.  Indian IT players are keeping a close watch on US president-elect Joe Biden''s approach and policies related to H-1B work visas that are used by a large number of Indian technology professionals. Biden is to be sworn in as the US president on January 20, 2021.  In June, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Donald Trump administration had banned the entry into the US of workers in several key non-immigrant visa categories, including H-1B, until the end of the year, arguing that they eat into American jobs.  Those affected include the family members of the H-1B, L-1, and certain categories of J1 visas. Later, certain exemptions in H-1B and L-1 travel bans were announced for those continuing employment with the same employer. The move that could help Indian IT professionals and those working in the healthcare sector.  The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.","Business, Companies, Infosys","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/weclose-to-63-visa-independentus-over-50europe-australia-new-zealand-infosys_14499821.html

612,2020-11-16 12:26:34+05:30,Hindalco Industries Ltd.,HINDALCO,Deal with Hindalco's Novelis puts focus on Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty Steel Group,"The deal between Novelis, the Hindalco Industries unit, and Alvance, Liberty's arm, has gone into arbitration","A deal between Hindalco Industries' unit and the aluminium arm of Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty Steel Group has put a spotlight on the Indian-origin businessman's conglomerate.  Is the arbitration, which the deal has gotten into, a normal course of action - especially because of changing circumstances amid the pandemic? Or, is it&nbsp;because the Liberty Steel Group is facing a financial squeeze?  The deal was necessitated after Novelis - Hindalco's North American arm - was asked by the European Commission last year to sell an aluminum facility in Duffel, Belgium, if it's acquisition of Aleris was to be cleared. Earlier in 2019, Novelis had agreed to buy Aleris for $2.8 billion.  In November, Novelis signed a deal with Alvance, the aluminium arm of Liberty Steel Group, to sell the unit for Euros 310 million. But after paying Euros 210 million, Alvance is yet to pay the remaining amount, forcing the arbitration.  &amp;quot;We believe that is a fair price and they have signed an agreement and will have to pay,&amp;quot; Hindalco Industries Managing Director Satish Pai said during a media interaction earlier in November.  Responding to a query from Moneycontrol, a spokesperson for Liberty Steel Group said, &ldquo;ALVANCE Aluminium Group completed the deal to acquire the Duffel recycling and rolling mill. This E100m is the subject of an agreed arbitration process, which is part of the transaction. The arbitration mainly relates to impacts on the state of the business due to COVID. ALVANCE Aluminium Duffel remains well funded and the arbitration will begin in 2021 as scheduled unless a settlement is agreed in advance.&rdquo;  Sources in the know added that Liberty Steel Group believes &amp;quot;the deal is complete at Euros 210 million, which is what its considers was due under the deal given the impact of COVID-19.&nbsp; Novelis do not agree and hence the arbitration&rdquo;.  Novelis, on its part, needed a speedy completion of the asset sale to ensure the Aleris acquisition got cleared at the earliest. Liberty now owns and operates the unit.  The rethink may have come about after Hindalco was forced to sell one of the Aleris assets in the US, much lower than its fair value. The asset was one of the two units that the company had to sell to get a go-ahead from the US Department of Justice for the deal.  Though initially over a dozen suitors lined up for the unit in Lewisport, post the pandemic struck, only private equity companies remained. Hindalco, eventually, sold the unit to American Industrial Partners, a private equity investment firm, for $170 million, half the fair value.  To read more about the deal: Why was Hindalco Industries forced to sell the US asset below fair value, leading to a dent in Q2 net profit?  At the same time, Alvance's reluctance to pay the full amount, and depending on how the arbitration goes,&nbsp;may&nbsp;bring relief to Liberty Steel Group.  &amp;quot;Globally, the steel industry is facing a glut of supply. Though demand has improved in the last couple of months, the situation is nowhere close to the pre-COVID-19 levels,&amp;quot; said a senior executive in the steel industry.  It's not just Liberty Steel Group. Nearly all steel peers, including ArcelorMittal, thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel's European operations are on the same boat. Interestingly, Liberty is in the running to acquire thyssenkrupp's steel operations. The thyssenkrupp acquisition alone can cost about $10 billion.  Liberty had earlier this year set off measures to control costs. It laid off employees in the UK and Australia. In June, the Gupta family&rsquo;s GFG Alliance, which includes the steel business, said it wants to cut costs by 30 percent and reduce the cash burn in a tough market.  In Australia, where a local daily The Australian - in a report on November 15 - said Liberty Steel Group incurred a loss of Australian dollars 124 million in the last financial year, senior officials have asked the local government against giving any further aid to the company.  It is a crucial time for Gupta, whose metals empire now spans more than 200 locations in four continents. These units employ 40,000 people and churn out 18 million tons of steel a year, generating revenue of about $12 billion. Little though is known more of its finances, as it is privately held.  The GFG Alliance, which is owned by Gupta's family and is the holding group company of all businesses, had last year promised to release consolidated accounts in early 2020. Later, group companies changed their accounting years to end in June, from March. But in April, the change was taken back.  In an interaction with Moneycontrol, soon after making his interest for thyssenkrupp official, Gupta reiterated that he has &amp;quot;support of the banks&rdquo;.  With several deals taking shape in multiple locations across the world, Gupta, industry observers say, should do more to instill confidence. &amp;quot;Support, both from banks and local government, will be crucial for the deals to go through. Also, many of the units that the company owns are being turned around, stressing the need for financial discipline,&amp;quot; says a industry executive who has worked in multiple locations across the world.  Interestingly, sources in the know say that while Liberty Steel Group is &amp;quot;serious and committed&amp;quot; about the Alvance-Novelis deal, the arbitration will hand the company more time. &amp;quot;An arbitration can take up to a year,&amp;quot; said one of the executives.  The story headline and text was updated after it was learnt that Novelis has already handed over the unit to Liberty, and the arbitration is being done, post the closure of the deal.","Business, Companies, Sanjeev Gupta","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/prince-mathews-thomas-7633/', 'name': 'Prince Mathews Thomas'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/dealhindalco39s-novelis-puts-focussanjeev-gupta39s-liberty-steel-group_14502241.html

EBITDA margins at the VE-CV segment encouragingly were at 6.9%, up 150 bps YoY despite ~28% volume decline for quarter YoY. Outlook For EML, we factor in 9%, 10% sales, PAT CAGR, respectively, in FY20-23E. The company continues to innovate (studio stores, MIY) to bolster its leadership position. Financials remain healthy as well (cash surplus B/S, double digit return ratios). Pace of RE ramp up and recovery in export volumes are key monitorables going forward. We maintain our constructive stance but await firmly positive rebound in volumes. Downgrading EML to HOLD, we value it at Rs 2,600 on SOTP basis (33 P/E to RE; 20 P/E to VECV on FY22E &amp;amp;amp; FY23E average PAT numbers).

622,2020-11-17 13:27:39+05:30,Tata Steel Ltd.,TATASTEEL,"Need more support from UK govt to secure operations in long term, says Tata Steel CEO Narendran",TV Narendran's call for help is important as the UK unit is under focus with the company in talks with SSAB to sell the Dutch arm of Tata Steel Europe. Can the UK unit survive by its own?,"Tata Steel has asked the UK government for more &amp;quot;substantive and permanent&amp;quot; options that will secure the company's operations in the country in the long term.  &amp;quot;The support we are looking for is a little more substantive and something more permanent, that will help us bring down cost of production and add value to the product mix. Or, help us over a period of time in making a transition to a greener facility,&amp;quot; Tata Steel&nbsp;CEO and Managing Director TV Narendran said in response to a Moneycontrol query, during a media briefing on November 17.  Narendran added that while the company has already got financial assistance from the UK government, this was more immediate in nature to help the company's present cash flow. The support is something that the government is giving to all companies, to tide over the impact of COVID-19.  The top executive however declined to quantify the support. He added: &amp;quot;That is not enough to make the business going in the long term.&amp;quot;  The UK unit of Tata Steel's European operations is under focus as the company has now engaged with Sweden's SSAB to sell the Dutch arm. On November 13, Tata Steel made official its talks with SSAB and said that it may take about six months to complete the process.  Both the UK and Dutch operations till now came under Tata Steel Europe. But now the two will be separated and the bigger and more profitable Dutch unit will be taken over by SSAB.  The Netherlands operations contribute about 70 percent of Tata Steel Europe business, and there have been concerns about the UK unit - which has struggled most historically - managing by itself.  The European operations come from Tata Steel's acquisition of Corus in 2006, a $13 billion-deal that the company has struggled to manage since then.  At the same time, the potential deal with SSAB will help the company partly or completely clear the debt of Euros 1.7 billion that Tata Steel Europe has. While the company has till now been mum on the deal value, industry observers put it at multi-billion dollars.  But will a standalone UK operations put a drain on its Indian parent?  Narendran doesn't think so.  &amp;quot;Last six months, Tata Steel Europe has been cash positive and neutral and hasn't got support from India. The UK operations are within sight of meeting the target of being self-sustainable,&amp;quot; he said.  &amp;quot;The mandate,&amp;quot; Narendran added, &amp;quot;is to run without India's support.&amp;quot;  It will give confidence that the European market has recovered well, with demand for steel picking up, especially from the auto industry. Though the company's consolidated net profit in the second quarter fell by over a half year-on-year, it swung to profitability after three quarters of losses.  While the company will bank on improved performance in the coming quarters- despite a re-surge in COVID-19 cases in Europe - it needs a more permanent solution to high production costs in the UK, where power rates are higher than in other countries.","Business, Companies, Tata Steel","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/need-more-supportuk-govt-to-secure-operationslong-term-says-tata-steel-ceo-narendran_14505021.html

625,2020-11-18 10:26:00+05:30,Hero MotoCorp Ltd.,HEROMOTOCO,Ather leads the pack as EV startups raise $63.5 million so far this year,"Ather alone accounts for $35 million. During 2019, the electric two-wheeler startups collectively raised nearly $100 million, which was 19 percent less than the $123 million in 2018, the best year for the industry.","Despite uncertainty clouding their future, thanks to the pandemic, two-wheeler startups in the electric vehicle (EV) space have managed to collectively raise more than $63.5 million this year.  According to data collated by Praxis Global Alliance, a global management consulting and advisory firm, electric two-wheeler startups raised $28.5 million between January and September 2020.  The aggregate got a further boost of $35 million a few days ago when&nbsp;the Hero MotoCorp-promoted scooter maker Ather Energy announced the successful completion of their funding-raising programme.  TVS Motor Company-backed Ultraviolette Automotive, which is building a high- performance premium electric motorcycle, raised capital in October but the company declined to provide the transaction details.  Speaking to Moneycontrol, Sanjeev Garg, Practice Leader &ndash; Automotive, Praxis Global Alliance, said: &ldquo;There are lots of entrepreneurial focus on electric two- and three-wheelers at present. Ather Energy is the company which has raised the bulk of funds from the electric two-wheeler category, followed by Ampere Vehicles&rdquo;.  During 2019, the electric two-wheeler startups collectively raised nearly $100 million, which was 19 percent less than the $123 million in 2018, the best year for the industry. Little over 40 percent of the entire $288 million raised by electric two-wheeler startups since 2016 was raised by Ather Energy alone, as per the Praxis data.  Since most companies have already gone through their funding rounds, there are little chances of further fund-raisings before the end of December, said a senior executive of a company, which tracks startup companies.  Over the past few years, startups have attracted investments from not just financial investors like venture capital firms and private equity companies but from large automotive companies such as&nbsp;Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor Company, Hero MotoCorp,&nbsp;Greaves Cotton&nbsp;and&nbsp;Bharat Forge.  Bajaj Auto invested in Bengaluru-based electric scooter rental startup Yulu Bikes, while Bharat Forge made a series of investments in Tork Motors, one of India&rsquo;s first electric bike makers. Engine maker Greaves Cotton fully bought out Ampere Vehicles, whereas two-wheeler leader Hero MotoCorp made multiple investments in Ather Energy.  How did they attract investments?  According to Garg, despite COVID-19, the valuations of these EV startups have only increased, leading to multiple increases on their returns. This has made the sector attractive for investments.  &ldquo;Return on funds have gone down in every investment -- be it real estate or financial markets. But investors need to invest somewhere and so the EV startup segment has become attractive as they have given thrice to 10-fold returns. Most businesses are now back to normal and now it all boils down to how the next 6-8 months period shape up. These startups have to perform as per their plans. If they are able to achieve those plans well, they will attract more investments in near future,&rdquo; added Garg.  Ather became the only exception to the soaring valuation story&nbsp;when Hero MotoCorp picked up an additional stake for Rs 84 crore at a lower valuation during the middle of the lockdown phase. However, Hero participated in the new funding round of Ather, which concluded in the first week of November with an investment of $12 million.  As per data shared by the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles (SMEV), sales of high-speed electric two-wheelers in India fell by nearly 27 percent to 7,552 units between April-September as compared to 10,161 units. The fall was largely attributed to COVID-19-induced lockdowns.  The sales outlook as predicted by SMEV&nbsp;remains positive, thanks to improving retail sales and the government&rsquo;s move, allowing registration of electric two-wheelers without batteries.  &amp;amp;nbsp;","Auto, Business, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/ather-leadspack-as-ev-startups-raise-36635-million-so-far-this-year_14508521.html

Under Johnson&rsquo;s 10-point plan, an investment of more than &pound;2.8 billion would be made in promoting the adoption of electric vehicles.","Car makers will have to expedite the shift towards electric or hybrid vehicles in Britain&nbsp;after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the ban on sale&nbsp;of petrol and diesel vehicles from 2030.  The impact of this move will be seen on more than 40 car brands, including Jaguar Land Rover, which is the UK&rsquo;s largest car producer, 100 percent controlled by Mumbai-based&nbsp;Tata Motors. JLR has a market share of just under 5 percent of the UK.  Slightly over one-fifth of JLR&rsquo;s global wholesale volumes gets generated within the UK alone. The country is also the third-biggest market for JLR in the world after China and the US, having sold nearly 60,000 units between January and September.  But by 2030, much of JLR&rsquo;s product portfolio would have already moved to fully electric vehicles or variants of hybrid powertrain going by the plans announced by the two luxury brands.  Starting this year, JLR committed itself to offering electrified options on all its new and refreshed products. It hopes to complete the transition to electric and hybrid vehicles before 2030.  Six new plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and nine new mild hybrid electric vehicles are slated for launch in 2021. JLR&rsquo;s first all-electric car Jaguar I-Pace went on sales in the UK in 2018.  To support and speed up the electrification strategy, JLR joined hands with German giant BMW to manufacture next-generation electric drive units. Its production will begin at Wolverhampton later this year. The start of operations of the battery assembly centre in Hams Hall, North Warwickshire, will also take place this year.  While the Jaguar I-Pace became the first model to debut with a fully electric powertrain, the all-SUV brand Land Rover will likely see the debut of its first all-electric model in 2021. The all-electric Jaguar XJ will also likely debut in the same year.  Under Johnson&rsquo;s 10-point plan, an investment of more than &pound;2.8 billion would be made in promoting the adoption of electric vehicles. Of this, &pound;1.3 billion will be spent on setting up charging points and &pound;582 million will be given away as incentives to buyers. Nearly &pound;500 million will be spent in the next four years on the development and production of electric vehicle batteries.  &ldquo;We will allow the sale of hybrid cars and vans that can drive a significant distance with no carbon coming out of the tailpipe until 2035&rdquo;, Johnson said in his address.  The UK joins Germany, Ireland, and the Netherlands in accepting the deadline as 2030 for banning petrol and diesel-powered vehicles.

633,2020-11-19 13:57:13+05:30,HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd.,HDFCLIFE,"HCL Tech, Sun Pharma among 10 largecap names that can give 8-30% returns in a year",Analysts and brokerage firms are bullish on market prospects as events such as the US election is over and positive reports on the vaccine front are giving hopes that soon COVID-19 will be under control.,"The Indian market is teeming with positivity, thanks to improving macro, better Q2 earnings and encouraging reports on the vaccine front, and most market experts believe the positive momentum will continue in new Samvat 2077.  Analysts and brokerage firms are bullish on market prospects as events such as the US election is over and positive reports on the vaccine front are giving hopes that soon COVID-19 will be under control.  Improving macroeconomic indicators are also signalling bulls will have enough fodder for jumping higher.  Global brokerage house Goldman Sachs has upgraded India to 'overweight' and raised Nifty's 2021-end target to 14,100.  Goldman Sachs is of the view that the market has moved higher as investors gained confidence in improving economic momentum.  Global brokerage firm Nomura is of the view that Nifty may hit the level of 13,640 by December 2021.  Brokerages suggest the following 10 large-cap ideas that can give up to 30 percent in Samvat 2077. Take a look:  Brokerage: HDFC Securities  Cadila Healthcare | Buy | LTP: Rs 429.40 | Target price: Rs 508 | Upside: 18%  As per the brokerage firm, the company's domestic and wellness businesses should grow in the high single digits and low-mid teens, respectively.  The stabilisation in the price erosion in the US generics business coupled with a strong pipeline would drive growth in the US business.  It has reduced net debt by Rs 2700 crore to Rs 4030 crore through fundraising of Rs 1000 crore (at the Zydus Wellness level) and a better working capital cycle in H1FY21.  &amp;quot;We estimate revenue CAGR of 8 percent over FY20-22E led by strong growth from wellness business, US market and domestic formulations. We project 150bps margin expansion led by gross margin expansion and operational efficiencies over FY20-22E,&amp;quot; said the brokerage.  Healthy revenues, better operating performance and lower interest expenses could drive 16 percent PAT CAGR over the same period.  United Spirits | Buy | LTP: Rs 553.25 | Target price: Rs 645 | Upside: 17%  United Spirits has been severely impacted by the pandemic due to government restrictions.  United Spirits, being the market leader, is expected to recover faster than peers on the back of a recovery in trade business, increase in at-home consumption, festive season sales, resumption in duty-free sales and benign commodity inflation.  &amp;quot;We recommend a buy on the stock at the current market price and add on declines to Rs 510-491 for a target of Rs 645 valuing the company at 52 times FY22 EPS,&amp;quot; said the company.  Brokerage: Nirmal Bang&rsquo;s Institutional Equities Research  HCL Technologies | Buy | LTP: Rs 830.50 | Target price: Rs 1,053 | Upside: 27%  The brokerage believes HCL Technologies will be an outsized beneficiary of the digital infrastructure build-out that has been catalyzed by the pandemic and which will likely be a 3-5 year opportunity.  HCL Tech has the highest leverage to this opportunity among Indian players with what we estimate to be a 30 percent revenue exposure.  HCL Tech will also benefit from a pick-up in Digital transformation spends on both services (Mode-2) and products (Mode-3). This will likely help the company deliver growth outperformance in an industry that will likely see growth acceleration of 300-400bps after delivering 6-8 percent organic growth over FY15-FY20.  The brokerage values HCL Tech at a target P/E of 18.8 times September 2022E EPS, which is at a 25 percent discount to the target P/E multiple of TCS.  Hindustan Unilever (HUL) | Buy | LTP: Rs 2,188 | Target price: Rs 2,555 | Upside: 17%  The brokerage firm believes that HUL offers the best earnings growth visibility in the large-cap Indian consumer space, justifying premium valuation even though return ratios have dropped due to the impact of the merger.  Sun Pharmaceutical Industries | Buy | LTP: Rs 514 | Target price: Rs 618 | Upside: 20%  The brokerage believes the US business for Sun Pharma (excluding Taro Pharmaceuticals and Dusa Pharmaceuticals) should start growing as 92 ANDAs (abbreviated new drug applications) and 6 NDAs, which are pending approval, gradually start reflecting in incremental revenues.  Price erosion in base business is unlikely to be painful as the same is now commoditised with a median competitive intensity of eight players across its marketed ANDA portfolio.  In addition to complex ANDAs, Sun Pharma is also aggressively developing value-added generic drugs that are targeting the following segments: 1) Patients suffering from dysphagia. 2) Dosing convenience. 3) Improved health care administration.  The domestic business should deliver a low double-digit growth and outpace the Indian pharmaceutical market driven by its large exposure to the chronic segment. the brokerage said.  UltraTech Cement | Buy | LTP: Rs 4,890.25 | Target price: Rs 5,640 | Upside: 15%  Over the last 2 years, UltraTech has acquired Binani Cement (renamed as UltraTech Nathdwara) as well as Century Textile&rsquo;s Cement division.  For Q2FY21, Century&rsquo;s EBITDA/mt was in excess of Rs 700 and capacity utilization at 68 percent. Ultratech Nathdwara&rsquo;s capacity utilisation stood at 60 percent and EBITDA/mt at more than Rs 1,500.  &amp;quot;We are building in 5 percent/7 percent/16 percent CAGR in revenue/EBITDA/PAT for the company over FY20- FY23E,&amp;quot; said the brokerage.  Analyst: Narendra Solanki, Head- Equity Research (Fundamental), Anand Rathi Shares &amp;amp;amp; Stock Brokers  Dr.Reddy's Laboratories | Buy | LTP: Rs 4,875.60 | Target price: Rs 6,012 | Upside: 23%  Dr. Reddy&rsquo;s offers an array of the portfolio of products and services, including APIs, custom pharmaceutical services, generics, biosimilars and differentiated formulations.  As of now, 101 generic filings are pending for approval with the USFDA comprising 99 abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) and 2 NDAs.  Also, the company expects 28 filings to have first to file status.  In a major development, the company settled litigation with Celgene, relating to patents for REVLIMID Capsules. Celgene has agreed to provide Dr.Reddy&rsquo;s with a license to sell volume-limited amounts in the US post-March 2022 and without volume limitation beginning on Jan 31, 2026, subject to regulatory approval.  The latest settlement provides significant revenue opportunities to the company in the $7.6 billion REVLIMID market with few players.  The company remains on track to launch over 25 new products including some niche and limited competition products in its North America Generics business in FY21.  &amp;quot;While the company should benefit from the gradual price stabilization in US business, we expect growth across markets driven by an increase in volume and continued new launches,&amp;quot; said the analyst.  Also, recent market developments signal the potential for the expansion of its API business. The analyst is optimistic given the company&rsquo;s strong balance sheet and management's focus on building a healthy product pipeline, improving efficiency, controlling costs and streamlining operations.  Hero MotoCorp | Buy | LTP: Rs 3,105 | Target price: Rs 3,653 | Upside: 18%  The two-wheeler industry is witnessing high demand due to the lack of public transport availability &amp;amp;amp; social distancing norms in place due to COVID-19.  The company is currently operating at nearly 100 percent production capacity with almost all customer touchpoints open.  With the peak festival season coming up in the months of October and November, the company&rsquo;s management is positive about achieving high sales numbers with the help of positive consumer sentiments.  &amp;quot;With the improvement in demand and improving macro-economic data especially from rural areas, we believe the auto 2-wheeler industry is set to bounce back faster and Hero Moto being a market leader in its segment should also benefit in medium-term,&amp;quot; said the analyst.  Bharti Airtel | Buy | LTP: Rs 479.90 | Target price: Rs 625 | Upside: 30%  The analyst believes Bharti Airtel is poised for decent ARPU growth for India Mobile business though there might be some short term impact on 4G subscriber additions.  Revenue prospects look promising with improving performance in the Africa business. Further, with revenue market share gain and decent network capacity compared to peers, the company is well placed for long term growth in the telecom space.  The company remains focused on expanding networks, extending coverage particularly in rural areas, along with continued investments in data centers, home broadband and other lines of business.  The company is also refarming almost all of its spectrum, hence all 3G spectrum is moving to 4G.  The management expects moderation of CAPEX in FY21 compared to FY20. Recently, the company inked a deal with a global investment firm, The Carlyle Group, under which the latter will invest US$235 million in Nxtra Data Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bharti Airtel engaged in the data center business.  The company looks to benefit from this investment given Carlyle&rsquo;s prior experience in data centre ownership through investments in Coresite in the US and Itconic in Spain.  HDFC Life Insurance Company | Buy | LTP: Rs 635.55 | Target price: Rs 685 | Upside: 8%  Life insurance has emerged as an important avenue for both protection as well as long-term savings products.  The management stated that the company has been experiencing growth in renewal with normalization being witnessed in premium collection rates.  The company reported a 34.8 percent year-over-year increase in gross premium to Rs 10,182.5 crore in Q2FY21, driven by strong growth in new business premium as well as renewal premium.  As of September 30, 2020, the Assets Under Management (AUM) stood at Rs 150.6 crore, increasing 15 percent YoY.  The company&rsquo;s market share in terms of Individual Weighted received premium (WRP) grew by 235bps to 17.5 percent.

Consolidated EBITDA rose 60% YoY to INR61.1b in 2QFY21 (the highest in the last six quarters), and we estimate 3QFY21 to be even stronger at INR71.6b (+98% YoY). Furthermore, net debt fell INR83b QoQ to INR988b (the lowest in the last six quarters), led by working capital release of INR103b. The potential divestment of the company&rsquo;s profitable Netherlands operations to SSAB could lead to further deleveraging.

EBITDA stood at Rs3.98bn vs. our estimate of Rs3.8bn and OPM was 11.6% - above our estimate of 9.4%. Key positives: 1) capacity utilization of VSF improved to 88% in Q2 from 26% in Q1; 2) capacity utilization of caustic soda improved to 80% in Q2 from 49% in Q1; and 3) 28%/34% yoy fixed-cost reduction for the VSF/Chemical segment. Grasim has approved the divestment of its fertilizer business for a consideration of Rs26.49bn. This deal is expected to get completed in 9-12 months. It has entered into an agreement with Lubrizol which will help improve chlorine sales, and Grasim will receive a fixed annual compensation. Outlook We raise EBITDA estimates for FY21/22/23 by 20%/4%/1% on higher volumes and lower fixed cost. Lower caustic soda prices due to surplus capacities will continue to affect the profitability of the Chemical segment.

While EBITDA declined 40% YoY to INR4b in 2Q, it is now expected to grow YoY in 3QFY21. Sale of low RoCE Fertilizer business for ~USD350m has been carried out at a good valuation (12x FY20 EV/EBITDA) and would help GRASIM substantially deleverage. We raise our EBITDA estimate by ~4% to factor in better volumes and SoTP-based TP by ~10% to INR805 due to higher market price of subsidiaries. While the holding company discount at 53% is above the 10-year average of 47%, we maintain our Neutral rating as we do not expect the same to shrink significantly. Outlook Given GRASIM&rsquo;s conglomerate business structure, we value it on a SoTP basis.

The mega transaction cements the position of Reliance Retail as the undisputed leader in the organised retail segment and adds muscle to its ongoing battle with Amazon for the Indian e-commerce market.  Reliance Retail-Future Group deal: RIL unit adds Future Group&rsquo;s retail business to shopping cart for Rs 24,713 crore.&nbsp;  The Future Group houses leading retail formats, including supermarket chain Big Bazaar, upmarket food stores Foodhall, and bargain clothing chain Brand Factory. The acquisition is being done as part of a scheme in which Future Group is merging certain companies carrying on the aforesaid businesses into Future Enterprises Ltd (FEL).  The announcement comes as a setback to Amazon.com which has claimed that Future Group violated its agreement with the US e-commerce giant by entering into the deal with RIL.  Amazon had moved the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in October and won an interim stay on the deal. The SIAC passed the interim order asking Future Group to hold its plans of selling its retail business to RIL on October 25.&nbsp;  Amazon, last year, had bought a 49 per cent stake in one of Future's unlisted firms, Future Coupons Ltd, with the right to buy into FRL after a period between three and 10 years. Future Coupons owned a 7.3 per cent stake in Future Retail.  Along with this, Amazon even wrote to market regulator SEBI, stock exchanges and CCI seeking a stay on the deal.  Later, Kishore Biyani-led Future Retail Ltd (FRL) on November 7 moved the Delhi High Court against Amazon.com for interfering in its Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Industries (RIL) by misusing the arbitration order passed by SIAC.

639,2020-11-20 19:46:40+05:30,ICICI Bank Ltd.,ICICIBANK,RBI report: Doors could be finally open to large business houses to launch banks,In the past RBI has been hesitant to allow large businesses to promote banks. The indications are that this approach could change now,"The big takeaway from the report of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)&rsquo;s internal working group (IWG) on ownership guidelines for private banks is the proposal to allow large corporate and industrial houses to promote private banks.  In the past, the RBI has been largely hesitant to let large businesses promote banks.  In the previous rounds, when the RBI had issued private bank licences, the banking regulator had permitted corporate houses to apply, but turned down their applications, and preferred financial institutions which had experience in banking transactions.  That approach may change now.  The proposal, however, comes with certain riders. According to the IWG recommendations, large corporate/industrial houses may be allowed as promoters of banks only after necessary amendments to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.  This is aimed at preventing connected lending and exposures between the banks and other financial and non-financial group entities and strengthening of the supervisory mechanism for large conglomerates, including consolidated supervision.  The other major takeaway from the proposals is to allow large non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) to convert into banks. Well-run large NBFCs, with an asset size of Rs50,000 crore and above, including those which are owned by a corporate house, may be considered for conversion into banks, subject to completion of 10 years of operations and meeting due diligence criteria and compliance with additional conditions specified in this regard.  This too will help many corporate houses running NBFCs under their fold to become banks if they wish to do so.  The last time (2013-14) when the RBI invited applications for new private banks, a host of corporates including Tata Sons; the Aditya Birla Nuvo, part of the Aditya Birla conglomerate; L&amp;amp;amp;T Finance Holdings, part of India's largest engineering conglomerate Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro; Reliance Capital; and INMACS Management Services Ltd, which provides management consultancy, corporate finance, audit, tax, and legal advisory services, had applied for permits.  Only Bandhan and IDFC got licences.  Focus on NOHCs  The IWG group has put lot of emphasis on the Non-operative Financial Holding Company (NOFHC) model. NOFHCs should continue to be the preferred structure for all new licences to be issued for universal banks. However, it should be mandatory only in cases where the individual promoters/promoting entities/converting entities have other group entities, the group has said.  While banks licensed before 2013 may move to an NOFHC structure at their discretion, once the NOFHC structure attains a tax-neutral status, all banks licensed before 2013 shall move to the NOFHC structure within five years from announcement of tax-neutrality, the report said.  Till the NOFHC structure is made feasible and operational, the concerns with regard to banks undertaking different activities through subsidiaries/ joint ventures/associates need to be addressed through suitable regulations. However, banks currently under the NOFHC structure may be allowed to exit from such a structure if they do not have other group entities in their fold.  The RBI has issued bank licences in three rounds since liberalization. In the first round in 1993-94, the RBI gave licences to 10 private sector banks, namely Global Trust Bank Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd, UTI Bank Ltd (renamed Axis Bank Ltd), Bank of Punjab, IndusInd Bank Ltd, Centurion Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank Ltd, Times Bank, and Development Credit Bank Ltd.  In 2003-04, two more banks were given licences&mdash;Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd and Yes Bank Ltd. In 2014 IDFC First Bank and Bandhan Bank were given the licence.  The different guidelines on capital norms and ownership guidelines in each round had created confusion on appropriate rules. It is in this context that the IWG proposals are important.  The proposals have clearly said the RBI should take steps to ensure harmonisation and uniformity in different licensing guidelines, to the extent possible. Whenever new licensing guidelines are issued, if new rules are more relaxed, benefit should be given to existing banks, and if new rules are tougher, legacy banks should also conform to new tighter regulations, but a non-disruptive transition path may be provided to affected banks, it said in its report.  Promoter holding   There seems to be an attempt for consensus with respect to the percentage of stake the private bank promoter can eventually hold. The cap on promoters&rsquo; stake in the long run (15 years) may be raised from the current level of 15 per cent to 26 per cent of the paid-up voting equity share capital of the bank, the RBI group has said.  As regards non-promoter shareholding, a uniform cap of 15 per cent of the paid-up voting equity share capital of the bank may be prescribed for all types of shareholders, the proposals said.  There were tussles between private bank promoters and the regulator with respect to promoter holding. Private sector lender, Kotak Mahindra Bank had taken the regulator to court in connection with a dispute on promoter Uday Kotak&rsquo;s holding. The RBI let the promoters, Uday Kotak and family, retain 26 percent stake, but capped the voting rights at 15 percent.  Similarly, the RBI had taken some punitive actions on Bandhan Bank for failing to reduce promoter holding. The restrictions were withdrawn after the bank complied with the regulations.  Overall, the IWG group recommendations address some of the contentious issues with respect to ownership norms of private banks.","Axis Bank, Bandhan Bank, Bank of Punjab, Business, Centurion Bank Ltd, Development Credit Bank Ltd, Global Trust Bank Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank Ltd, IDFCï»¿ First Bank, IndusInd Bank Ltd, Kotak Mahindra Bank ï»¿Ltd, RBI, stocks, Times Bank, Yes Bank Ltd","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/dinesh-unnikrishnan-9101/', 'name': 'Dinesh Unnikrishnan'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/rbi-report-doors-could-be-finally-open-to-large-business-houses-to-launch-banks_14516901.html

PDPU is only fourteen years old. Yet, it already ranks among the Top-25 in the Atal Ranking of Institutions on Innovation Achievements.  In terms of diversity, we attract international students from across the world. We have 284 international students from 39 countries.  And from a total of 132 students in the first convocation in 2009, we have 2,608 students, including 46 PhDs, graduating today.  From National Rankings, I am sure PDPU will soon earn a place in global rankings.  My dear teachers, PDPU has world-class physical infrastructure. But what gives me far greater joy is that PDPU has world-class faculty as well. Your dedication and commitment to excellence has been exemplary.  In the best practice of India's Guru Parampara, you have always gone beyond the call of duty. You have been friends, guides and mentors to your students. Let's take a moment to appreciate the leadership, faculty and all the staff of PDPU.  Friends, today I have a special reason to applaud PDPU. The COVID-19 pandemic has cast a shadow on the academic lives and careers of students across the world.  Precious hours of academic engagement, debate and research have been lost in lockdowns. Yet, our very own PDPU did exceptionally well even in these challenging times.  The flame of teaching and learning at PDPU shone brightest even during the darkest days of the pandemic. Our faculty continued to present award-winning research papers in national and international conferences. Our students continued to enjoy co-curricular and extra-curricular activities held digitally.  These facts make me proud of our university. But my heart swelled with greater pride when I learnt that PDPU also contributed to the nation's fight against COVID-19. Our teachers and students designed several medical equipment, including an ICU ventilator.  I salute the leadership of PDPU for combining Jnana with Seva. This combination is the greatest badge of honour for any educational institution.  Dear members of the PDPU Community, our accomplishments so far have been a source of joy.  However, we have to prepare ourselves to scale still higher summits of success.  The future of energy is being shaped by unprecedented changes. And these changes are impacting the future of humanity &mdash; indeed, the very future of our planet.  The most important question we face is this:  Can we produce the growing amounts of energy we need to sustain our economies without harming the environment?...Without failing to fulfil our climate change obligations? We must be prepared to answer this question with a CONFIDENT &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot;!  By the middle of this century, the world will use twice as much energy as we use today. In the next two decades, India&rsquo;s own per-capita energy needs will be more than twice as much as today.  Therefore, India is required to simultaneously pursue two goals: To become an economic superpower. To become a green and clean energy superpower.  To achieve these twin goals, we need disruptive solutions in renewables, low carbon and carbon recycle technologies. We need breakthroughs in new energy sources such as green and blue hydrogen. We also need great innovations in energy storage, saving and utilisation.  As a person from the energy business, I can assure the students and faculty of PDPU that you are entering an exciting future.  What makes it even more exciting is the synergy between the Energy Revolution and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. If we master this synergy, we will surely be able to make India one of the most prosperous nations in the world. An India that guarantees prosperity and wellbeing for all 1.3 billion Indians.  Honourable Chief Minister Shri Rupani ji, Gujarat is a trailblazer state. It has always shown the pioneer spirit. Today the entire world acknowledges that NEW GUJARAT has paved the path for NEW INDIA. The visionary leadership of Shri Narendra Modi ji that Gujarat received is now available to the nation.  I must compliment you and your team for making Vibrant Gujarat even more vibrant under the guidance of Shri Modi ji and Shri Amit Shah ji.  Here is our solemn assurance to you today. PDPU will continue to make its unique contribution to enhancing the reputation of Gujarat and India in energy education and research.  My dear Young Graduates, I see in you, 2,608 future builders of a strong, proud and vibrant India. My heartiest congratulations to you on your success. May all your dreams come true as you embark on a new journey in your life.  However, always remember an important life lesson. Learning is a constant and never-ending process of exploration, discovery and adventure. A true student never stops the pursuit of knowledge.  Therefore, here is my message to you, and I am only repeating Mahatma Gandhi's wise words: &amp;quot;Learn for life, Learn through life, and Learn throughout life&amp;quot;.  I have another message for you. When you step out of this beautiful campus, you will no doubt carry wonderful memories with you.  But perhaps you will also carry some concern, some uncertainty, some anxiety about the future.  This is only natural. The COVID situation will likely accentuate your thoughts and feelings.  Therefore, I would like to tell you with great emphasis today...venture out with supreme hope and confidence. The future is very bright for India, for you, and for all Indians.  This, our ancient nation, has faced many adversities in the past. And has emerged stronger each time. This is because resilience is in the very DNA of Indian people, Indian culture.  In the post-COVID era, I clearly foresee explosive and exponential growth in the Indian economy. Within a couple of decades, India will be among the top three economies in the world.  Growth will create unprecedented opportunities and possibilities for young and talented people like you. Indeed, most of these opportunities will be created by young entrepreneurs themselves. I see many amongst you as the creators of successful startups.  The world is waiting for you. Step out and take the plunge. Fail, if necessary, but in pursuit of your dreams. With passion, purpose and persistent effort, your dreams will indeed come true.  We, at PDPU, take pride in now calling you our alumni &ndash; our ambassadors. Make all of us at PDPU proud. Make your parents proud. Make India proud.  Once again, my hearty congratulations to the Class of 2019 and 2020. Good luck and God bless.  Thank you.

The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose, which has been detected before, during, and after the acute phase of illness, as well as in asymptomatic cases.  &amp;quot;Therefore, reducing the viral load in the mouth could help to reduce transmission. The findings indicate that mouthwash could become an important addition to other everyday protective measures like handwashing, physical distancing and mask wearing,&amp;quot; it added.

Unilever Oral Care Research and Development Head Glyn Roberts said, &amp;quot;While we are clear that this is not a cure or proven way to prevent the transmission of coronavirus, our results are promising.&amp;quot;  Roberts added that given the critical stage of the pandemic, the company feels it is important to share the results of the mouthwash.  This technology will be brought to India by Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), Unilever's arm, in Pepsodent Germicheck Mouth Rinse Liquid, which will be launched in India in December 2020, the company said.  Unilever said the test for its mouthwash containing CPC (cetylpyridinium chloride) technology was conducted by an independent and internationally accredited testing facility, Microbac Laboratories, on behalf of Unilever Research Laboratories in the US.  CPC is a widely used cosmetic ingredient, also used by the dental industry, and is known for its antibacterial and anti-virus benefits.  The test focussed on both 30 and 60 seconds rinse times, aiming to replicate the real-life use of mouthwash in an in-vitro context.

MSI Executive&nbsp;Director (Marketing and Sales) Shashank Srivastava said the Maruti Suzuki Subscribe&nbsp;program has received encouraging response from customers with over 6,600 enquiries in the first few months of pilot launch.  &amp;quot;The Maruti Suzuki Subscribe program comes with a bouquet&nbsp;of benefits like flexible tenure, zero down payment, insurance and complete maintenance,&amp;quot; Srivastava said adding that &amp;quot;we are aiming to introduce the Maruti Suzuki Subscribe program in 40-60 cities over a period of 2 to 3 years&amp;quot;.  The program also provides 24x7 roadside assistance and customer support.  &amp;quot;We are confident that with the flexibility Subscription provides to customers, in addition to convenience and a hassle free&nbsp;experience, it will surely find a lot of takers in the post pandemic fast changing world of mobility,&amp;quot; ORIX India MD and CEO Sandeep Gambhir said.  The partners are witnessing an increased need from customers to have personalized and customized solutions and flexible ownership options as against the traditional ways of owning cars, and Subscription does just that, Gambhir added.  Under the Maruti Suzuki Subscribe, users can opt from a wide range of the company''s vehicles such as Swift, Dzire, Vitara Brezza, and Ertiga from Maruti Suzuki ARENA and Baleno, Ciaz, and XL6 from NEXA. The monthly subscription fee varies depending on the model and city.  For instance, the subscription fee starts from Rs 14,665 per month for Swift LXi model in Ahmedabad, the company said.","Auto, Business, Companies","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/maruti-suzuki-subscribe-launchedfour-more-cities_14524061.html

And facilitating with timely and affordable deliveries will enable them to compete much better, JSW Steel Director - Commercial Marketing and Corporate Strategy - Jayant Acharya said.","JSW Steel has launched a dedicated website for MSMEs to help them purchase steel even in smaller quantities, a top official said on Tuesday.  MSMEs are usually smaller companies which produce various products for domestic and international markets. And facilitating with timely and affordable deliveries will enable them to compete much better, JSW Steel Director - Commercial Marketing and Corporate Strategy - Jayant Acharya said.  &amp;quot;With this aim, JSW Steel has launched (website) JSW For MSME. We are encouraging MSMEs to register so that we understand their requirements better.&nbsp;JSW Steel extends help to MSME with preferential pricing for its steel products, the dedicated sales team for MSMEs,&amp;quot; he added.  Acharya further said micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) account for 30 per cent of India''s GDP. The target is to take this contribution to 50 per cent by 2024-25.&nbsp;In India, there are over 60 million MSME units and many of them are engineering exporters.  Engineering exports in 2019-20 was about USD 76 billion and the government''s aim is to double it to USD 150 billion by 2024-25. JSW basically would also like to participate and enable this growth for the MSMEs, he noted.  On MSMEs problem in sourcing steel, the director said as they are smaller companies, and their lot size is very small. If someone requires a couple of tonnes of a product, it is really difficult for them to access through imports or other markets on a regular basis.  For imports, MSMEs need to have a three-month window and nobody is going to book 100 tonne or 200 tonne orders for them. So, for them to predict international market development becomes very difficult. Because of this mismatch, their ability to respond to the international market in time and participate in growth is limited, he said.  &amp;quot;I believe there are more than 60 million MSMEs in the country. Suppose even 1 million buys 100 tonne of steel per year that means 100 million tonne. We would encourage more and more MSMEs to come and register on the site and JSW Steel will supply (directly) or through our distributor channels,&amp;quot; he added.","Business, Companies","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/jsw-steel-launches-website-to-help-msmes_14524441.html

On the hourly scale, the index broke above the 5-day long consolidation and moved above the 13,000 level to test a new life-time high of 13,079.  A simple bar chart analysis shows that the index is forming a higher high higher low pattern, indicating it is in a bullish mode.  Any corrections may be bought into (buy on dips).  The immediate resistance is placed at 13,450 which also happens to be the level where we can see the highest call writing for the December series.  The extrapolated moves may even take Nifty to the next level of 13,769 which is 127.2 percent retracement of earlier fall from 12,430 to 7,511.  We expect the index to remain bullish and continue to move higher as long as it remains above the 12,742 level.  Here are three buy calls for the next 3-4 weeks:  Tata Steel | LTP: Rs 548.25 | Target price: Rs 645 | Stop loss: Rs 480 | Upside: 18%  Tata steel has been one of the strongest outperformers among the metals.  The stock has been making a higher high higher low pattern for the last 3 weeks after breaking out of a 2-year-old downward slopping channel.  In the previous week, it breached a crucial level of Rs 500 which is a 50 percent retracement level of the fall from Rs 750 to Rs 250.  Both the above-mentioned breakouts were backed by above-average volume, indicating participation in the breakout.  Going ahead, the crucial level to watch out for on the upside is Rs 560 which is a 61.8 percent retracement level of the fall from Rs 750 to Rs 250.  Beyond this, we can expect it to test Rs 645-650 which is a 78.6 percent retracement level of the fall from Rs 750 to Rs 250.  A red flag level for the stock is Rs 480, below which we might see the stock to test Rs 440-400 level.  Motherson Sumi Systems | LTP: Rs 145.30 | Target price: Rs 182 | Stop loss: Rs 130 | Upside: 25%  Motherson Sumi has been forming a higher high higher low pattern, after breaking out of a bullish continuation pattern.  This breakout was backed by above-average volume, indicating interest in the stock as the prices broke out of a 13-week long consolidation.  In the past, we saw a breakout and a close above the Rs 130.80 level which is the 38.3 percent retracement of the fall from Rs 263 to Rs 48.65.  A simple multiple timeframe analysis shows that an immediate resistance is placed at Rs 156. If the prices manage to break above this level, we expect the Rs 182 level to be tested.  A crucial support level is placed at Rs 130, which ideally should act as a change in polarity level.  If this level is breached, we might see the stock go south towards the Rs 110 level.  Tata Consumer Products | LTP: Rs 526 | Target price: Rs 650 | Stop loss: Rs 500 | Upside: 24%  The stock has started the up move after bouncing off the 20-week simple moving average.  The stock has moved 16.5 percent in the previous 6 weeks. A simple look at the bar pattern suggests that the stock has started its next leg on the upside.  On the higher timeframe, we can see the stock has formed a bullish engulfing pattern.  The immediate resistance level is placed at Rs 540, above which, we can expect a further up-move towards Rs 590 and eventually towards Rs 650 level.  A caution level for the stock is Rs 500 level, below which we can see it touch the Rs 460 level.

On November 24, Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) announced a lockout for the second time at both of its plants. A section of the employees had been on strike and this has affected production.  Nearly half of Toyota&rsquo;s volumes are safe as 50 percent of its production is outsourced to Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC), the parent company of&nbsp;Maruti Suzuki India&nbsp;(MSIL).  Toyota Glanza and Toyota Urban Cruiser are manufactured at SMC&rsquo;s Gujarat plant and MSIL&rsquo;s Gurgaon, Haryana plant, respectively. As of October-end, both models accounted for nearly 50 percent of Toyota&rsquo;s sales in India.

The launch came just a day after TKM Following the directions of the Government of Karnataka, the management at TKM had withdrawn the lockout, effective November 19, 2020. However, even after the withdrawal of the lockout by TKM, only few workmen reported to work as per their shift schedule while a majority of the striking workers&rsquo; union members continued with their strike.

TKM alleged that post the withdrawal of lockout, around 400-500 union members were trying to barge into the plant&rsquo;s premises forcibly every day at unscheduled hours.  &ldquo;Such hostile activities have created a volatile situation around the factory premises and unsafe conditions for other employees of the company,&rdquo; said the spokesperson.  &ldquo;Moreover, a few members are also instigating the illegal strike and disrespecting other members who want to return to work or those who are already working and taking on the additional burden caused by the strike.

Today, its market share is still around 3-3.5%. With most models failing, the company is sticking around, pinning hopes on India&rsquo;s move towards electric mobility over the next few decades.","The first week of December 2020 will mark the 10th anniversary of Toyota&rsquo;s first made-for-India product. Launched in December 2010, the Etios sedan was to become one of the largest-selling proucts for the Japanese giant in India.  Aspirations riding on the Etios were such that Toyota targeted to grab 10 percent of the Indian car market by 2015, up from 3 percent back then. The Etios Liva, the sedan&rsquo;s hatchback version, which was launched in the first half of 2011, was to add incremental volumes. Both were developed on the lines of the hugely popular Maruti Suzuki Swift Dzire and Swift.  Both models were perceived to be the first serious attempt by Toyota to crack the mass market segment, which accounted for more than 85 percent of the Indian car market.  Like Honda, Toyota, too, had established itself as a premium brand in India. The Camry luxury sedan was launched in 2002, Corolla, a premium sedan in 2003, followed by the Fortuner, a premium sport utility vehicle (SUV) in 2009.  The Etios and Liva brought the entry price of a Toyota car to below Rs 10 lakh, a record broken only once earlier by the boxy-looking Qualis, which was priced at Rs 6 lakh and launched in 2000.  Toyota stopped producing the Qualis in 2005 to make way for the Innova, which was launched in the same year.  In April 2018, Toyota introduced the Yaris sedan to take on Honda City, Maruti Suzuki Ciaz and Hyundai Verna, among others. Prior to this launch, its regular models such as the Corolla (Corolla Altis), Innova (Innova Crysta), Camry (Camry Hybrid) and the Fortuner received upgrades.  Following the switchover to Bharat Stage VI emission norms from April 1, 2020, Toyota decided to pull the plug on the Etios, Liva and the Corolla Altis.  Cut to the present  By the first week of next month, Toyota will find itself in the same position as it did a decade ago. Its market share by the end of November is expected to remain around 3-3.5 percent. It was 3.4 percent by the end of October as per data shared by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).  The slight increase in market share was thanks to the deal between Toyota and Suzuki Motor Corporation. As per the arrangement, Suzuki agreed to manufacture and supply the Baleno and Brezza to Toyota, which were rebadged to Glanza and Urban Cruiser, respectively, before they hit showrooms.  As of October, the two models accounted for nearly 50 percent of Toyota&rsquo;s India sales. The balance is mainly driven by the Innova Crysta.  Innova Crysta, the premium multi-seater contributes 36 percent to Toyota&rsquo;s sales in India, and accounts for nearly 70 percent of the company&rsquo;s output from the two plants it runs in Karnataka.  Despite being one of the first multinational auto companies to enter India (1997), Toyota has struggled to get its footing right. In comparison, Kia Motors, which entered India only last year, have grabbed a 6 percent share on the back of just three products.  Why is Toyota sticking around?  &ldquo;Toyota has its own way of developing and understanding a market, which is often a time-consuming process. The pace at which the Indian car market changed, with consumer preferences changing every four to five years, Toyota did not anticipate it and struggled to cope up. Toyota is taking its cost lessons from Suzuki, a world leader in small car technology, for the time being,&rdquo; said a Mumbai-based analyst tracking the auto sector.  India intends to move towards electric mobility over the next few decades. This should augur well for the Japanese giant as it has been working in the field of electric and hybrid vehicles for several years.  Through the joining of hands with Suzuki, Toyota wants to roll out an affordable range of electric and hybrid vehicles in India. Though hybrid vehicles (at 28 percent) do not enjoy the same GST as electric vehicles (at 5 percent), a softening of stance by the government is expected.  The Camry Hybrid, for example, is priced at Rs 40 lakh, and the Volvo XC 90 at Rs 1.35 crore, and Lexus NX at Rs 55 lakh.  Workers&rsquo; strike &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The company is now seeing a workers&rsquo; strike at two plants in Bidadi, Karnataka of Toyota Kirloskar Motor. However, the company says they only play a minimal role in the company&rsquo;s operations.  Since nearly half of its sales are not even produced in the plants, Toyota has been able to avoid a supply issue of at least two models. The Glanza and the Urban Cruiser are made in Gujarat and Haryana, respectively, by Suzuki and Maruti Suzuki. The Innova Crysta is still manufactured at one of the plants using limited manpower.","Auto, Business, Technology, Toyota","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/toyota-etios-marks-10th-anniversary-next-month-a-look-atcompanyÃ¢ÂÂs-ambition-duringlaunchwhere-it-stands-now_14529861.html

Its market share by the end of November is expected to remain around 3-3.5 percent. It was 3.4 percent by the end of October as per data shared by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).  The slight increase in market share was thanks to the deal between Toyota and Suzuki Motor Corporation. As per the arrangement, Suzuki agreed to manufacture and supply the Baleno and Brezza to Toyota, which were rebadged to Glanza and Urban Cruiser, respectively, before they hit showrooms.  As of October, the two models accounted for nearly 50 percent of Toyota&rsquo;s India sales. The balance is mainly driven by the Innova Crysta.  Innova Crysta, the premium multi-seater contributes 36 percent to Toyota&rsquo;s sales in India, and accounts for nearly 70 percent of the company&rsquo;s output from the two plants it runs in Karnataka.  Despite being one of the first multinational auto companies to enter India (1997), Toyota has struggled to get its footing right. In comparison, Kia Motors, which entered India only last year, have grabbed a 6 percent share on the back of just three products.  Why is Toyota sticking around?  &ldquo;Toyota has its own way of developing and understanding a market, which is often a time-consuming process. The pace at which the Indian car market changed, with consumer preferences changing every four to five years, Toyota did not anticipate it and struggled to cope up. Toyota is taking its cost lessons from Suzuki, a world leader in small car technology, for the time being,&rdquo; said a Mumbai-based analyst tracking the auto sector.  India intends to move towards electric mobility over the next few decades. This should augur well for the Japanese giant as it has been working in the field of electric and hybrid vehicles for several years.  Through the joining of hands with Suzuki, Toyota wants to roll out an affordable range of electric and hybrid vehicles in India. Though hybrid vehicles (at 28 percent) do not enjoy the same GST as electric vehicles (at 5 percent), a softening of stance by the government is expected.  The Camry Hybrid, for example, is priced at Rs 40 lakh, and the Volvo XC 90 at Rs 1.35 crore, and Lexus NX at Rs 55 lakh.  Workers&rsquo; strike &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The company is now seeing a workers&rsquo; strike at two plants in Bidadi, Karnataka of Toyota Kirloskar Motor. However, the company says they only play a minimal role in the company&rsquo;s operations.  Since nearly half of its sales are not even produced in the plants, Toyota has been able to avoid a supply issue of at least two models. The Glanza and the Urban Cruiser are made in Gujarat and Haryana, respectively, by Suzuki and Maruti Suzuki. The Innova Crysta is still manufactured at one of the plants using limited manpower.","Auto, Business, Technology, Toyota","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/toyota-etios-marks-10th-anniversary-next-month-a-look-atcompanyÃ¢ÂÂs-ambition-duringlaunchwhere-it-stands-now_14529861.html

Wadhawan has filed a petition in the Mumbai NCLT against the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)-appointed administrator in the matter.  Wadhawan has also requested access to data on DHFL's assets.  So far, there is no clarity on the bidding process for the troubled lender which was caught in a series of alleged financial irregularities.  Lenders to DHFL are likely to call for another round of bids, seeking higher value for its assets.  The bidders to DHFL include Adani Group, Piramal Enterprises, US-based Oaktree, and Hong Kong-based SC Lowy.  SC Lowy had submitted 10-70 percent higher price for either a stake in the company or buying out some of its assets.  Oaktree Capital has raised its bid price for the entire portfolio to Rs 33,000 crore from Rs 27,800 crore earlier.  There is a possibility that lenders may seek fresh bids seeking higher value.  Earlier, in a letter to administrator on November 11, Wadhawan had requested the RBI-appointed administrator to allow him to participate in the next meeting of the CoC so that he could &ldquo;put forth some of these thoughts to the CoC on the video conference to constructively aid in the resolution process of DHFL&rdquo;.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m presently handicapped as I have no access to the records of the company to ascertain the present position, and I&rsquo;m constrained to rely on the newspaper reports as well as my knowledge and experience of having run the business for more than 15 years,&rdquo; Wadhawan said.  If given access to the records, he can make a proposal setting out the necessary upfront and deferred payment components, which will provide maximum value realization for all stakeholders, Wadhawan said.  DHFL is the first financial services company which has been sent to the NCLT under the insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC).  In his letter, Wadhawan repeated his offer to pay up the entire principal amount to all creditors without any haircut, besides letting all creditors convert part of their debt to equity.  &ldquo;Even today, I am willing to stand by the principle of 100 percent repayment of principal amounts to all the creditors without any hair cut as I do believe, from DHFL&rsquo;s business, that such recovery is possible,&rdquo; Wadhawan said in the letter.  DHFL is facing claims of Rs 87,031 crore from financial creditors.  Its large lenders include State Bank of India (including SBI Singapore) with Rs 10,083 crore exposure, Bank of India Rs 4,125 crore, Canara Bank Rs 2,681 crore, NHB Rs 2,434 crore, Union Bank of India Rs 2,378 crore, Syndicate Bank Rs 2,229 crore, and Bank of Baroda Rs 2,075 crore, Indian Bank Rs 1,552 crore, Central Bank Rs 1,389 crore, IDBI Bank Rs 999 crore, and HDFC Bank Rs 361 crore.  DHFL posted a net loss of Rs 2,122.65 crore in the quarter ended September, 2020, as compared with a net loss of Rs 6,640.62 crore in the corresponding quarter in the previous year.  It had posted a profit of Rs 70 crore in the first quarter.  Total assets of the company stand at Rs 83,638 crore as of September-end, compared with Rs 85,926.95 crore in the March quarter. Total liabilities stood at Rs 91,250.13 crore in the September quarter as against Rs 91,326.19 crore in the preceding quarter, the company informed exchanges on November 26.  In the results note, auditors said the company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern depends upon the outcome of the ongoing corporate insolvency resolution process.","Business, DHFL, HDFC Bank, India, Kapil Wadhawan, SBI, stocks","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/dinesh-unnikrishnan-9101/', 'name': 'Dinesh Unnikrishnan'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/dhfl-promoter-kapil-wadhawan-moves-nclt-seeking-participationcoc-meeting-access-to-data_14530761.html
659,2020-11-26 22:28:37+05:30,Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.,TCS, FC Kohli no more: Father of Indian IT industry had &lsquo;a tough-love&rsquo; management style that pushed...,"FC Kohli, the first CEO of TCS, is widely hailed as the father of Indian IT industry. He was known as a sharp business mind with a variety of interests","Ask those who knew him well and they would remember Faqir Chand Kohli, the first Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), as the father of the Indian IT industry.  Kohli, who last spoke to Moneycontrol in October, passed away on November 26 of natural causes. He is survived by his wife and three children.  &amp;quot;Mr. Faqir Kohli formed and led TCS from its&nbsp;founding days. He guided the company in its early years and defined the&nbsp;vision for its growth,&amp;quot; said Tata group patriarch and Chairman Emeritus Ratan N Tata.  &amp;quot;His early vision played an important role in creating the outstandingly successful global IT company that TCS has become today,&amp;quot; Tata added.  Tata also said: &amp;quot;Kohli's&nbsp;contribution in various technology-oriented areas was significant. and he will be remembered as one of the fathers of India&rsquo;s successful IT industry.&amp;quot;  He was gracious, unassuming, and always willing to help,&nbsp;Tata noted.  Other senior Tata leaders echo those views.&nbsp;&ldquo;Kohli was a brilliant technocrat and a business leader with varied interests. He was passionate about the development of our nation and its youth,&rdquo; said former CEO and Vice Chairman of TCS S Ramadorai, who took over after Kohli retired.  Kohli, who was 96 years old, ran TCS more like a promoter, which was to mean that it was his own company and that he never allowed resources to be wasted just because it could be put on the corporate balance sheet, said management consultant Hiru Bijlani, who was a long-time friend of the Kohlis.  &ldquo;He made very sure he ran a tight ship,&rdquo; &nbsp;Bijlani said, adding that Kohli had a&nbsp;&ldquo;tough-love&rdquo; management style and pushed through more barriers for Indian IT than people are aware of.  That&rsquo;s something that even Ramadorai recalls experiencing. &ldquo;He always challenged me by presenting me with different situations and new opportunities in our early days. This was something I learned from him and imbibed as I grew to build my teams at TCS later,&rdquo; Ramadorai said.  &ldquo;I will forever cherish the opportunity to have worked with a stalwart like him,&rdquo; he added.  Kohli was roped in from the Tata Electric Companies, and was instrumental in the decision to bring IBM to India as part of Tata-IBM in 1991. His role in setting up TCS and running it later is well documented.  He became the director of the company in 1970 and was appointed as the first CEO of TCS later. He retired in 1999 at the age of 75 by which time the profits of TCS were as much as if not more than most of the other group companies, Bijlani said.  Kohli, who had a green thumb and spent time in his garden in Alibaugh, was also a frequent golfer. He shot to an 18-handicap and hit a long ball even at the age of 80, and applied the same approach to work. &ldquo;His work continued well after he retired, with pursuits that included educating the less fortunate through word recognition programmes and by pushing for more recognition for engineering programmes and the industry in India,&rdquo; Bijlani said.  In his free time, Kohli would continue to read up on the latest developments in technology and engineering and admitted in earlier interviews that most of it was &ldquo;very technical&rdquo;.  Both the career&nbsp;highs that he cherished had to do with recognition from professional bodies. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, or IEEE, which was a professional association for electronic engineering and electrical engineering with its corporate office in New York City, honoured Kohli with a fellowship, making him at the time the only non-American in the world to get it.  The other accomplishment he regarded highly was becoming a member and fellow of the South East Asia Computer Society and was the only non-Singaporean to get it.  Voltas's former Managing Director Nawshir Khurody, who knew him in his early career, said: &amp;quot;Whenever I reached him for help as a young TAS officer,&nbsp;Kohli would set aside everything and reach out to help him. His passing has brought back memories of how few people like him are left in the Tata group. He was a humble genius and a very remarkable man.&rdquo;  Khurody remembered how at the breakfast table in Pune at the Tata Management Training Centre, Kohli took the toast rack at breakfast,&nbsp;handed it to him, and said &amp;quot;here you need it more than me&amp;quot;.  Kohli &nbsp;never cared what car he drove or what he wore or about the trappings of leadership and power. &amp;quot;At the training centre, he would ask the most junior people the names of the trees and was never afraid to learn from them,&amp;quot; Khurody recalled, adding that two things Kohli would tell everyone were: All software and computer work should be done in Indian languages and that India cannot become a super power until IT is extensively deployed across the country.  &amp;quot;We will always be reminded of the huge contribution Mr Kohli made to the Tata group. It is his vision, passion, discipline and commitment that set the culture in TCS. The grounded yet dynamic culture in TCS is a reflection of his strength of character, and I believe is what sets it apart from most of its competitors, said Cyrus Mistry, former Chairman of Tata group.  &amp;quot;His vision not only gave birth to TCS, but established the whole software industry in India, it is this tremendous contribution that earned him the coveted Padma Bhushan so richly deserved by him,&amp;quot; he added.  A social tippler who would enjoy his single malt whiskey responsibly, Kohli was known to be direct and even ribbing friends on their dress-sense when they wore shirts that looked like table cloths.  At his home in the Air India Building at Nariman Point, guests were welcomed to warm hospitable entertainment with either jazz music or ghazals playing in the background.  Because TCS&rsquo; first office was opposite the Air India Building, where he lived, the joke was that he walked across the road and built the TCS building. Later he went there to work out of his office right until the end before the lockdown came into effect in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.  &ldquo;During my interactions with him, I had become a firm believer that most people rise to new challenges,&rdquo; Ramadorai observed. &ldquo;He was also my mentor, guide and a very close family friend, and his demise is a personal loss to our family.&rdquo;  At his farewell, the Tata group organised a going away bash at the Taj Hotel in Colaba and had celebrated Indian flautist Hariprasad Chaurasia perform at the function which was attended by the top brass at the group.  &ldquo;The nation has lost a true visionary and legend today,&rdquo; Ramadorai said.

Earlier, Dr Reddy's partnered with RDIF to conduct clinical trials, manufacturer and distribute 100 million doses of Sputnik V vaccine in India.  ","Russia&rsquo;s sovereign wealth fund RDIF&nbsp; and drug maker Hetero have agreed to produce 100 million doses of Sputnik V vaccine every year in India.  The parties intend to start the production of Sputnik V in the beginning of 2021.  Along with Russia, currently Phase III clinical trials are approved and are ongoing in Belarus, the UAE, Venezuela and other countries, as well as Phase II-III in India.  This is second such partnership by an Indian company&nbsp;with RDIF.&nbsp; Earlier Dr&nbsp;Reddy's partnered with RDIF to conduct clinical trials, manufacture and distribute 100 million doses of Sputnik V vaccine in India.  Interestingly, as per the partnership with RDIF both Dr Reddy's and Hetero&nbsp;not just supply to Indian market but also export the vaccine to other countries.  RDIF said requests for more than 1.2 billion doses of Sputnik V vaccine came from more than 50 countries. The vaccine supplies for the global market will be produced by RDIF&rsquo;s international partners in India, Brazil, China, South Korea and other countries.  Follow Moneycontrol's COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker here.  &amp;quot;We are pleased to collaborate with RDIF as a manufacturing partner for the most anticipated Sputnik V vaccine for the treatment of COVID-19,&amp;quot; said&nbsp;B. Murali Krishna Reddy, Director &ndash; International Marketing, Hetero Labs.  &amp;quot;While we look forward to the clinical trial results in India, we believe that manufacturing the product locally is crucial to enable swift access to patients,&amp;quot; Reddy said.  Hetero was in forefront in bringing therapies for COVID-19 such as antiviral drugs remdesvir and Favipiravir. The company along with Cipla were the first companes to be approved to sell Gilead's drug remdesivir in India.  &ldquo;We are delighted to announce the agreement between RDIF and Hetero that will pave the way to production of the safe and highly effective Sputnik V vaccine on Indian soil,&amp;quot; said&nbsp;Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of&nbsp;RDIF.  &amp;quot;I am confident that Sputnik V should become an integral part of the national vaccine portfolio of every country willing to protect its population from the coronavirus,&amp;quot; Dmitriev added.  The Gamaleya Center and RDIF November 24 announced positive results obtained during the second interim data analysis of the late stage clinical trials in Russia&rsquo;s history involving 40,000 volunteers.  Russian authorities claimed the vaccine&nbsp;demonstrated 95 percent efficacy on the 42nd day after the first dose (equivalent to 21 days after the second dose).  The Russian vaccine is based on two different&nbsp;human adenoviruses as vectors, which the RDIF says allows for a stronger and longer-term immune response as compared to vaccines using one and the same vector for two doses.","Business, Companies, coronavirus, COVID-19 vaccine tracker, Health, sputnik v","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/viswanath-pilla-6848/', 'name': 'Viswanath Pilla'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/russia39s-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccine-to-be-producedindia-rdifhetero-agree-to-make-over-100-million-doses_14532981.html

665,2020-11-29 12:56:56+05:30,Tata Motors Ltd.,TATAMOTORS,Flag Pattern break out suggests buying opportunity in Tata Motors,Tata Motors has given sharp move sharp or nearly vertical move towards Rs 170 levels from 135 which has formed pole of the Flag pattern.,"Flag Pattern is one of the most popular chart patterns formed by price action which is contained within a small rectangle or a channel in the shape of a flag. Flags are short-term continuation patterns that mark a small consolidation before the previous up move resumes.  A flag chart pattern is formed when the market consolidates in a narrow range after a sharp move. Flags pattern breakout usually gives low risk &ndash;high reward opportunity. The flag pattern set up occurs in an on-going rally or decline phases, the pattern results in a move in the prior direction. Flags can be seen in any time frame but normally consist of about 5 to 15 price bars.  Why Buy Tata Motors?  There are pressure areas in a stock chart, which may be minor support or resistance, or it may even be a minor target point. In this zone some traders book profit; however, the trend remains unchanged. This may result in a small swing or the price may remain flat. Both the support and resistance lines are either horizontal or sloping downwards in an uptrend or sloping upwards in a downtrend, forming a flag. These patterns are usually preceded by a sharp advance or decline with heavy volume, and mark a midpoint of the move. The pattern has a &amp;quot;flag&amp;quot; appearance because the small rectangle is connected to the pole (the large and swift move).  Tata Motors has given a nearly vertical move towards Rs 170 levels from Rs 135 which has formed pole of the Flag pattern. Flags are often considered continuation patterns, meaning that the breakout tends to theoretically occur in the direction of the preceding move, and in case of this stock a close above Rs 175 has confirmed the breakout. The formation usually occurs after a strong trending move that can contain gaps. At the same time, decisive trading above moving averages is also supportive for price movement. Looking at mentioned parameters one can stay long in Tata Motors. Figure.1. Flag pattern and Buy signal on Tata Motors Buy Signal  1. A decisive close above resistance line (Rs 175) of Flag pattern, has given a pattern breakout. 2. Prices are already trading above short-term moving average 20 DMA (Rs 155) which will define bullish short-term trend. 3. Mid- term moving average 50 DMA (Rs 142) defines mid-term trend which augurs well with bulls as prices are sustained and trading above it. 4. Decent volume participation while pattern breakout will also give additional confirmation.  Profit Booking  Target as per Flag pattern is calculated by adding the length of the Flag to the breakout point. But looking at the momentum, the stock will get close to Rs 200 which is the high made in January this year.  Stop Loss  Entire bullish view negates on breaching of the support line of the flag pattern on closing basis. In that case, one should exit from the long position, for Tata Motors these levels are placed around Rs 162.  Conclusion  We recommend buying Tata Motors around Rs 178 levels with a stop loss of Rs 162 for higher targets of Rs 200.

Speaking to PTI, JSW Steel Director - Commercial Marketing and Corporate Strategy Jayant Acharya said it is the same site near the port of Paradip where POSCO was keen to set up a 12 MTPA steel plant.  The Odisha government and POSCO had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in this regard in 2005. However, the South Korean steel giant had to abandon its proposed Rs 52,000-crore project due to multiple reasons from delay in environmental clearances to protests by locals.  The pact ultimately expired in 2010 and was not renewed again.  &amp;quot;We have plans to expand through both acquisitions and brownfield expansions and then followed by greenfield (project) if we are looking in terms of Odisha,&amp;quot; Acharya said.  The company plans to set up an integrated steel plant of 13.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) capacity in Odisha along with a 900 MW power plant for captive usage with an investment amount of Rs 53,700 crore.  Replying to a question on land acquisition for setting up the project, Acharya said, &amp;quot;We have already identified that (land) and the acquisition of that land is going on. Along with the Odisha government...we are doing...the land acquisition part.&amp;quot;  It is the same land where POSCO was earlier looking to set a 12 MTPA steel plant, he said.  However, Acharya didn''t provide a timeline for completion of land acquisition process.  The process is on and such processes take some time, he said.  &amp;quot;Whatever necessary allocations are coming to us which are ready for payment we would be doing that,&amp;quot; Acharya added.  JSW Group had approached the Odisha government for land after POSCO shelved its plan to set up the steel plant. Subsequently, all statutory clearances given to POSCO were transferred to JSW Steel.  Last year in December, the hearing for the company''s project was conducted.  &amp;quot;JSW''s hearing was conducted peacefully and successfully. That is a huge development. The integrated project has been passed unopposed with almost the same investment that POSCO was looking for...We expect the work to start soon on the Rs 53,700 crore project,&amp;quot; IPICOL Managing Director Nitin B Jawale had said.  The Industrial Promotion and Investment Corporation of Odisha (IPICOL) is the single point of contact for all industrial investments in the state.","Business, Companies","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/jsw-steelthe-processacquiring-land-for-steel-plantodisha-director-jayant-acharya_14537741.html
667,2020-11-30 09:11:31+05:30,Bajaj Auto Ltd.,BAJAJ-AUTO,"Exclusive: Bajaj, KTM parent firm restart talks on stake transfer","Bajaj Auto holds 48% in the Austrian bike maker. The discussions are being held between Bajaj Auto International Holding BV, the Netherlands-based subsidiary, and Pierer Industrie AG, the parent company of Pierer Mobility AG.","Bajaj Auto&nbsp;and partner KTM have restarted talks on transferring the 48 percent stake held by the Indian company in the Austrian bike maker back to its holding entity.  Bajaj Auto&rsquo;s 48 percent equity, along with the 51.7 percent stake held by Pierer Mobility AG, make up the shareholding of KTM AG, the legal entity that is responsible for making products under its own brand, Husqvarna and GasGas brands.  KTM Group and Bajaj Auto are holding discussions to transfer the 48 percent stake of Bajaj Auto in KTM AG to the listed company Pierer Mobility AG. The discussions are being held between Bajaj Auto International Holding BV, the Netherlands-based subsidiary, and Pierer Industrie AG, the parent company of Pierer Mobility AG.  Although finer details of the proposed realignment of the partnership has not been shared by either companies, sources say that this would kick-start a new chapter in the 13-year-old partnership that has so far seen joint design and development of products, common use of manufacturing facility, overseas distribution pact and joint marketing and sales.  The two companies had held the same discussions in March 2019, with the transaction decision targeted to be made in the second quarter of the same year. But less than three months later, both companies aborted the plan for unspecified reasons.  &ldquo;Pierer Mobility AG was informed by Pierer Industrie AG and Bajaj that they have restarted discussions on assessing the possibility of transferring Bajaj's 48 percent stake in KTM AG to Pierer Mobility AG, with the Pierer Group continuing to retain the controlling majority over Pierer Mobility AG&rdquo;, a statement from Pierer Mobility AG said.  What is different this time is the proposal to make PTW Holding AG, a newly formed entity by KTM, the 60-percent stake holder in Pierer Mobility AG. This translates to transferring the said 60 percent stake from Pierer Industrie AG to PTW Holding.  &ldquo;Pierer Industrie AG and Bajaj will now evaluate the proposal in detail,&rdquo; the statement further added.  The authorised capital enables a capital increase of up to 50 percent of the existing share capital. After the transaction, the stake of Pierer Mobility AG in KTM AG will increase from the current 51.7 percent to approximately 99.7 percent, the statement added.  KTM increases 2020 forecast  The announcement of restarting discussions of stake transfer comes less than two months after the Austrian bike maker increased the forecast for the second half of 2020, following sustained high demand for all brands including e-bikes.  The management board of Pierer Mobility AG decided to increase the sales forecast published at the end of August 2020 for the second half of 2020 to over &euro; 850 million (previously &euro; 800 million). Around 64 percent of KTM&rsquo;s revenues come from Europe, followed by North America, and Mexico with 17 percent.  Riding on Bajaj  The partnership with Bajaj Auto made the Austrian company the world's biggest premium bike manufacturer, beating US heavyweight Harley-Davidson (in volumes) in 2018 and 2019.  Of the 90,331 motorcycles sold in the first half of 2020, 22 percent was manufactured and sold by Bajaj Auto in India and Indonesia. In return, Bajaj has benefited from technology sharing and becoming the sole manufacturer of KTM and Husqvarna bikes outside of Europe, with exports reaching the US, Japan and South Asia.  From worldwide volumes of 280,099 units clocked in 2019, KTM is expecting to sell around 400,000 two-wheelers in 2022. This will include nearly doubling of production at Bajaj Auto&rsquo;s Chakan, Pune-based plant to 200,000 units, from around 108,000 units at present. This will include a mix of joint products (of KTM and Husqvarna bands) and KTM products distributed by Bajaj on a licence fee model.  The two companies have also started work on electric two-wheelers. The first of such e-bikes having power range between 3 and 10 kW (48 volts) will roll off the Chakan production line. The platform will support various product variants under the brand of both the partners.  KTM is developing a 4kW electric scooter under the Husqvarna brand whose market launch is expected to take place in 2021. This will be followed by the launch of Husqvarna E-Pilen, a 4kW/10kW, fully electric motorcycle with modular battery system. The Husqvarna E-Pilen is expected to be launch-ready in 2022.  &amp;amp;nbsp;","Auto, Bajaj Auto, Business, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/exclusive-bajaj-ktm-parent-firm-restart-talksstake-transfer_14538601.html

Though the prices are introductory and valid till December 31, 2020, the starting price is a full Rs 1.72 lakh less than the Nissan Magnite&rsquo;s nearest rival Kia Sonet which is priced at Rs 6.71 lakh. The Sonet was launched only a few months ago.  Also Read: Nissan Magnite review: Features and specifications of the compact SUV  The top-end variant of the Nissan Magnite has been priced at Rs 9.35 lakh. Senior Nissan India officials said the Magnite has reached showrooms and is ready for deliveries to customers.&nbsp;  Besides the Kia Sonet, the Nissan Magnite will compete against Tata Nexon, Hyundai Venue, Maruti Suzuki Brezza, Ford EcoSport, Mahindra XUV300, Toyota Urban Cruiser and the Mahindra TUV300.&nbsp;  The SUVs Maruti Suzuki S-Presso and the Mahindra KUV100 sit a level below the Magnite in terms of price and vehicle size. Kia Seltos is the market leader of the segment which generates monthly volumes of 40,000-50,000 units.  Also Read: A look at Nissan Magnite, India's cheapest compact SUV  Only one engine is on offer on the Nissan Magnite, which is in petrol but there is a turbo version too. Along with partner Renault, Nissan has also decided to give up diesel engines. In all, there are four primary variants of the Magnite and two engine options. Three of the ten trims offered are in automatic (CVT).&nbsp;  The 1.0 litre, five-speed manual, naturally aspirated version of the Nissan Magnite generates 72ps of power while the turbocharged version with a five-speed manual and automatic transmission generates a maximum power of 100ps.  The turbo manual is claimed to deliver a mileage of 20km/litre as against 18.75km/litre claimed for the naturally aspirated version. The automatic version claims to deliver 17.7km/litre. There will be four dual-tone colours on offer in addition to the four mono-tone colours.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Magnite is the first sub-4 meter compact SUV from Nissan and the 12th product in the segment overall.

679,2020-12-02 13:36:34+05:30,Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.,MARUTI,November auto sales show YoY rise in volume; brokerages name 8 stocks to look at,"A significant pick-up in demand was seen for commercial vehicles (CV) while passenger vehicles (PV), two-wheelers (2W) and tractors also did well.","On expected lines, most automakers witnessed a rise in monthly volume on a year-on-year (YoY) basis for the month of November even though volume declined on a month-on-month basis.  As the festival&nbsp;period is&nbsp;over, it was expected that the demand will ease on monthly basis.  A significant pick-up in demand was seen for commercial vehicles (CV) while passenger vehicles (PV), two-wheelers (2W) and tractors also did well.  Ashutosh Tiwari, Head of Research at Equirus Securities pointed out there was an element of pent-up demand as sales were lower in Q1FY21, but the shift towards personal mobility was also a reason behind demand pick up.  &amp;quot;Sales also benefited from increased savings of service class and government employees as there were limited avenues for spending since the COVID outbreak. Lower finance cost is also helping demand,&amp;quot; Tiwari said.  As the economy is improving and the vaccine for COVID-19 looks near, is the road for automakers going to be smooth now?  Brokerages and analysts expect volumes to improve in the coming quarters on strong rural sentiment, low-interest&nbsp;rates, improving finance availability and a gradual pick-up in the business and economic activity.  &amp;quot;We believe that post the festive season, the inventory for passenger car OEMs is below the average 30-day levels, which has led to the growth. Over the rest of the year, we expect sales trends to be better than what was earlier expected as the economy is gradually normalising,&amp;quot; said Aditya Makharia, Institutional Research Analyst (Auto), HDFC Securities.  However, the road for all segments is not going to be the same.  &amp;quot;Festive season sales were reasonable, with no major negative surprise. Current demand and low inventory sentiment in PV and tractor suggest higher wholesales in the coming months. On the flip side, 2W and CV OEMs are expected to maintain a cautious stance, with no major inventory push,&amp;quot; said brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services.  &amp;quot;Valuations reflect for recovery to sustain in the coming quarters, leaving a limited margin for safety for any negative surprises. Hence, we prefer companies with: a) higher visibility in terms of demand recovery, b) a strong competitive positioning, c) margin drivers, and d) balance sheet strength,&amp;quot; Motilal Oswal added.  Tiwari of Equirus Securities believes there is likely to be a sluggish period over the next 2-3 months due to seasonal weakness post festivals, but he expects demand to pick up again from March-April 2021 as rural demand will pick up post-harvest and with COVID cases subsiding even earnings of business class people will revive.  Brokerage firm ICICI Securities pointed out that the rising incentive schemes across segments post-festive season, lack of price increase even in wake of higher input costs correlate with the fragility of the consumer sentiment.  &amp;quot;We believe channel inventory clearance remains a key priority for December; thus, expect incentives to increase further by the end of Q3,&amp;quot; ICICI Securities said.  Pankaj Bobade, Head - Fundamental Research, Axis Securities is of the view with the festive season now over in India, the auto industry volumes to moderate in Q4FY21 as the pent-up demand is tapering down and fresh demand has to kick in to sustain the growth.  &amp;quot;Generally, the December month witnesses tepid growth at the retail level, as the end-users await the vehicle with chassis plate of the new year. Hence, the short-term (2 months) outlook would be relatively soft compared to the festive season but we expect the auto industry to post a strong double-digit recovery over FY22 and FY23 on the back of improving fundamentals, a low base of FY20 and FY21 and recovery in the other sectors of the economy,&amp;quot; Bobade said.  Rusmik Oza, Executive Vice President and Head of Fundamental Research-PCG at Kotak Securities has a cautious view on the automobile sector as stock prices have rallied smartly on the back of better results and healthy volume growth.  &amp;quot;We expect net profits of the automobiles sector to increase 11 percent in FY21 despite very low volumes in Q1FY21 (affected by the nation-wide lockdown in the months of April and May 2020),&amp;quot; Oza said.  For the medium-term, Oza expects the motorcycle industry to grow at 12-20 percent in FY22-23 after a sharp decline in FY21. He expects the domestic car industry to grow by 14-22 percent during FY22-23E after a sharp decline in FY21.  &amp;quot;We expect a moderate decline in FY21E EBITDA margins of the OEMs given lower volumes that will result in negative operating leverage and higher costs related to the implementation of new fuel emission standards (BS-VI fuel standards applicable from April 1, 2020. We expect EBITDA margin to improve in FY22 on the back of higher volumes (positive operating leverage),&amp;quot; Oza said.  Mitul Shah, Head of Research at Reliance Securities believes that demand for automobiles would remain healthy over the medium to long-term, though the pace of growth may taper down.  &amp;quot;We may see some slowdown over near-term due to post-festival effect, while FY22 would be strong for the sector with healthy double-digit growth,&amp;quot; Shah said.  Stocks to focus  Global financial firm Morgan Stanley expects all segments of the auto sector to recover sharply in 2021.  It expects growth to taper off in Q3 and rebound sharply in Q4.  &amp;quot;Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra, Bajaj Auto &amp;amp;amp; Eicher Motors remain our preferred overweights. Motherson remains a top pick among suppliers,&amp;quot; Morgan Stanley said.  Brokerage firm CLSA highlighted that the volume recovery continued but lower than the peak in October.  CLSA said it prefers deep cyclical plays such as Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland.  Brokerage firm Emkay Global Securities said its top picks are Maruti Suzuki (Target price: Rs 8,216), Hero Motocorp (Target price: Rs 3,839) and Eicher Motors (Target price: Rs 3,025).  Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal said Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra and Hero MotoCorp are its top OEM picks.  Axis Securities likes Hero Motorcorp and Bajaj Auto in the two-wheeler space and expects Maruti to do well in the PV Segment. It expects Ashok Leyland to outperform as it is well-positioned to benefit from the cyclical upturn in the CV industry.  Brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher likes Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra, Ashok Leyland, Maruti and Motherson Sumi.  Reliance Securities prefers Ashok Leyland and Escorts within automobile space.  Basudeb Banerjee, Research Analyst, Ambit Capital said his top picks in the OEM space are TVS Motors and Eicher Motors (Royal Enfield).  &amp;quot;Premiumisation of two-wheelers is a long-term phenomenon and Royal Enfield will be the biggest beneficiary of that sustainably,&amp;quot; he said.

Domestic steel price continues to witness upward movement with price hike of ~Rs. 3,000/tonne in November. Further price hikes are likely in December as domestic price is still at a discount to China steel prices and demand-supply situation remains tight. We expect steel margin to increase by 30%-40% or Rs. 3,000-4,000/tonne q-o-q in Q3FY2021E, backed by price hike. Thus, we increase our FY2021-FY2023 earnings estimate for JSW Steel. Dolvi capacity expansion would increase JSW Steel&rsquo;s domestic capacity to 23 mtpa from 18 mtpa and drive volume growth over FY2022E-FY2023E.  Outlook Retain Buy on JSW Steel with a revised PT of Rs. 432 as strong earnings momentum is likely to continue in H2FY2021E, led by steel price hike and weak coking coal price, offsetting higher iron ore price.

HDFC Bank says it expects the actions will have no impact on its existing credit cards, digital banking channels.","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has asked&nbsp;HDFC Bank&nbsp;to temporarily halt sourcing new credit cards and stop the launch of its digital business-generating activities planned under Digital 2.0 and other proposed business generating IT applications.  The RBI issued the order dated December 2, 2020, to&nbsp;HDFC Bank.  The RBI action comes after the central bank on November 23&nbsp;sought an explanation from HDFC Bank&nbsp;after its digital services were disrupted from the evening of November 21 till November 22 morning - for over 12 hours.  The order also states that HDFC Bank&rsquo;s board must examine the lapses and fix accountability.  &ldquo;The above measures shall be considered for lifting (the restrictions) upon satisfactory compliance with the major critical observations as identified by the RBI,&rdquo; it added.  In fact, the RBI order takes into account incidents of outage in HDFC Bank&rsquo;s internet banking, mobile banking and payment utility services over the past two years.  HDFC Bank had attributed the outage on November 21 to a power failure in the bank&rsquo;s primary data centre.  Complaints against HDFC Bank  On November 21, customers had complained of the&nbsp;payment stack being inoperative. The bank said this was due to an unexpected outage at one of its data centres.  An HDFC Bank official had told Moneycontrol that the glitch was due to a power outage in DAKC data centre, Mumbai, which has several banks as clients.  A similar incident took place on December 3, 2019, with customers complaining that they were&nbsp;unable to pay their loan EMIs or settle credit card bills&nbsp;on time. When contacted, the bank then told Moneycontrol that &ldquo;a technical glitch&rdquo; had caused the issue and this was being worked on by experts.  &ldquo;Due to a technical glitch, some of our customers have been having trouble logging into our NetBanking and MobileBanking App. Our experts are working on it on top priority, and we&rsquo;re confident we&rsquo;ll be able to restore services shortly. While we deeply regret the inconvenience caused, there&rsquo;s no cause for undue concern,&amp;quot; it had said.  Later, it was found out that the outage took place because the bank&nbsp;&amp;quot;underestimated&amp;quot; growth in payment volumes&nbsp;and the disruption was more of a capacity issue.  The bank also dismissed the rumour of a cyber attack. It added that the same had been communicated to the banking regulator.  HDFC Bank&rsquo;s response  HDFC Bank sought to reassure customers, stating: &ldquo;(HDFC Bank) expects&nbsp;the&nbsp;current&nbsp;supervisory&nbsp;actions&nbsp;will&nbsp;have&nbsp;no impact&nbsp;on&nbsp;its&nbsp;existing&nbsp;credit&nbsp;cards,&nbsp;digital banking channels and existing operations and believes that these measures will not materially impact its overall business.&rdquo;  The bank, in its filing to the exchanges, said it has taken &ldquo;several measures to fortify its IT systems&rdquo; over the last two years and will continue to work to &ldquo;swiftly to close out the balance and would continue to engage with the regulator in this regard.&rdquo;  &ldquo;The&nbsp; Bank has always endeavoured to provide seamless digital banking services to its customers and has been taking conscious, concrete steps to remedy the recent outages on its digital banking channels,&rdquo; it added.

While replying to a question on whether the RBI is considering a framework for penalising such banks, Jain did not name HDFC Bank, but did say that the RBI is aware of the problem, while explaining that technical glitches had resulted in online banking getting impacted on December 2.  &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Later, after the repeat incident in November 2020, when digital services of HDFC Bank were disrupted for over 12 hours from the evening of November 21 till November 22, the RBI sought an explanation from the bank.","banking, Business, HDFC Bank, India, RBI, services, video","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/hdfc-bank-outage-a-timelinethe-bankÃ¢ÂÂs-run-insdigital-disruptionswhat-rbi-has-done_14548901.html

We have taken help of external expertise, understood what needs to be done further and have substantially implemented the inputs to strengthen our IT infrastructure and systems,&rdquo; Jagdishan said in a letter to customers.  &ldquo;Unexpectedly another incident happened on November 21,2020, and the primary reason for the same is the power outage in our primary data centre. We are working on war footing to strengthen this area also now,&rdquo; Jagdishan said.  Jagdishan assured customers that there is no reason to worry. &ldquo;You can continue to transact with the bank without any concern,&rdquo; he said.  Jagdishan apologised for the digital outage to customers. &ldquo;We realize that as our valued customer, you expect us to maintain a very high standard of service quality and experience. And sometimes, we have not been able to live up to your expectations. For that, please accept our sincere apologies,&rdquo; the CEO said in the letter.  The RBI asked HDFC Bank to temporarily halt sourcing new credit cards and stop the launch of its digital business-generating activities planned under Digital 2.0 and other proposed business generating IT applications.  The RBI issued the order dated December 2, 2020, to HDFC Bank.  The central bank on November 23 had sought an explanation from HDFC Bank after its digital services faced disruptions on the evening of November 21 till November 22 morning - for over 12 hours.  The order also states that HDFC Bank&rsquo;s board must examine the lapses and fix accountability.  &ldquo;The above measures shall be considered for lifting (the restrictions) upon satisfactory compliance with the major critical observations as identified by the RBI,&rdquo; it added.  New launches after RBI&rsquo;s clearance  Jagdishan said the bank will now launch its digital initiatives after getting the RBI&rsquo;s approvals.  &ldquo;Some of our strategic digital initiatives to improve the front-end digital experience, improve digital origination, straight through processing, next generation of mobile and internet banking, API-based banking on the edge etc would now be readied and launched post the approval and clearance from the regulator,&rdquo; the CEO said in the letter.  Further, the bank will work with experts and the regulator to fortify the identified areas for improvement. &ldquo;Internally, we are looking at this as an opportunity to further improve ourselves and emerge stronger,&rdquo; Jagdishan said.  Banks are under immense pressure because of the competition to come up with new digital banking products, often without proper testing and leading to such failures, said senior bankers. &ldquo;There is intense competition from industry and new players such as payments banks to keep introducing new products. In their anxiety to remain at the top, banks often come with digital banking products that are not fully tested. Banks need to be careful to make sure they have enough technology capabilities to back such products,&rdquo; said Naresh Malhotra, a senior banking consultant.  To be fair, technical glitches aren&rsquo;t limited to HDFC Bank alone. Other banks too have been facing problems on the technical side, with the latest instance reported on State Bank of India&rsquo;s (SBI's) mobile banking application, YONO, in the last two days with customers&nbsp;complaining on Twitter&nbsp;that they are unable to login to the application following an error.

In a statement, the company said its board in a meeting approved capacity expansion to the tune of 12.8 MT per annum with a mix of brown-field and green-field expansion. Upon completion of the latest round of expansion, Ultratech's capacity will grow to 136.25 MT per annum, reinforcing its position as the third-largest cement company in the world, outside of China.  &amp;quot;The additional capacity will be created in the fast-growing markets of the eastern, central and northern regions,&amp;quot; the company said. This expansion includes the existing approval for cement plant at Pali in Rajasthan, in addition to the existing 6.7 MT per annum capacity expansion currently underway in UP, Odisha, Bihar and Bengal.  The expansion will get commissioned by FY22, in a phased manner, the company added. &amp;quot;The capital outlay, given the current economic backdrop, is a marker of UltraTech's ascent from being the country's No.1 cement player to a national champion,&amp;quot; Aditya Birla Group Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla was quoted as saying in the statement.  The cement industry has been witnessing healthy volumes after the relaxation in lockdowns, on the back of the government's thrust on infrastructure, underlying demand from the rural economy and individual home builders, he added. &amp;quot;Given our pan-India presence which will be further strengthened by the capacity expansion, we will be well positioned to support the rising demand for cement in the country,&amp;quot; Birla said.  Commercial production from the new capacities is expected to go on stream in a phased manner by the final quarter of FY23, Birla said, adding that the capacity addition will not impact the ongoing deleveraging programme to make UltraTech debt free by the time the expansion programme is completed.","Business, Kumar Mangalam Birla, UltraTech Cement","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/ultratech-to-invest-rs-5477-crore-to-add-128-mt-capacity_14550401.html

Now with the credit card, Rupifi and Axis Bank can enable business loans to these entities through the card.  The average credit limit offered will be in the range of Rs 1 and 2 lakh per month and will be decided based on business data of the MSME&rsquo;s transactions with the aggregator platforms, GMV (Gross Monthly Volume) of last six months and overall revenue among other factors.  &ldquo;This partnership will give Axis Bank an opportunity to tap into the unexplored and lucrative MSME segment, which is an addressable market of over $100 billion.

It would incur total capital outlay of Rs54.8bn with attractive capex cost of USD58/t, significantly below standard cost of USD75-80/t. This expansion is over and above the ongoing expansion of 6.7mnt. Nearly 52% of its new capacity would come in East region, which is already facing sharp surge in supplies. Intense competition pushed margins to new lows of Rs850-900/t in the region. However, lower margins were compensated by strong volume growth. We believe that strong fundamentals of the region and near bottomed out margins augur well for the expansion with aided advantage of low capex cost and superior logistics. Rest of the expansion is dedicated in attractive markets of North and Central India.

In fact, quite a few properties in the range of Rs 35 crore-Rs 55 crore have been registered in Mumbai after the&nbsp;state government decided to reduce stamp duty.  On November 25, former HDFC Bank Managing Director Aditya Puri's daughter Amrita Puri and wife Anita Puri jointly bought an uber luxury sea-facing unit in Mumbai&rsquo;s Malabar Hill area for Rs 50 crore.  Actress Amrita Puri made her film debut with the ensemble romantic comedy-drama Aisha&nbsp;(2010).  Aditya Puri&nbsp;is now a senior advisor at The Carlyle Group.  The unit, located in Lodha Seamont on Malabar Hill, near Raj Bhawan in Walkeshwar, is on the 19th&nbsp;floor and comes with seven car parking spaces.  Registration data accessed by&nbsp;Zapkey.com&nbsp;indicates that the unit was bought for Rs 50 crore and stamp duty worth Rs 1 crore was paid on the same.  The unit is located in a 22-storey building overlooking Raj Bhavan, the state governor's official residence. The development offers a limited selection of 3- and 4-bed residences and the homes afford stunning views of the Queen&rsquo;s Necklace (Marine Drive) and the Arabian Sea.  An email query sent to the Lodha Group remained unanswered.  Local brokers told Moneycontrol that the size of the &lsquo;jodi&rsquo; apartment bought by the Puris is likely to be around 3,800 to 4000 sq ft.  Homebuyers, including uber luxury property buyers, are rushing to register their properties before December 31 to save money by availing the stamp duty cut.  &ldquo;A reduction of 1 percent to 2 percent is a big amount for high-value &nbsp;apartments,&rdquo; says &nbsp;Ritesh&nbsp;Mehta, Senior Director &amp;amp;amp; Head &ndash; West India,&nbsp;Residential&nbsp;Services,&nbsp;JLL&nbsp;India.  Post the stamp duty cut announced by the Maharashtra government in August, the stamp duty collection in September alone stood at Rs 900 crore in Mumbai, of which 40 percent&nbsp;came from luxury transactions.  Local brokers say most of these properties were bought during the under-construction stage and are being registered now. &ldquo;The savings in terms of stamp duty cut as well as the saving on GST (which is 5 percent since the project has received an occupation certificate) is around 8 to 10 percent,&rdquo; they said.  In order to boost the stagnant real-estate market hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Maharashtra government on August 26 decided to temporarily reduce stamp duty on housing units from 5 percent to 2 percent until December 31, 2020. Stamp duty from January 1, 2021, until March 31, 2021, will be 3 percent.  On September 21, lawyer Cyril Shroff and his daughter Paridhi Karan Adani, who is Gautam Adani&rsquo;s daughter-in-law, jointly bought an uber luxury unit in Mumbai&rsquo;s Worli area for Rs 36.3 crore. The unit, located in 360 West by Oberoi Realty, is spread across 583.53 sq m. It is registered under the name APC Benefit Trust.  ALSO READ:&nbsp;COVID-19: Are Mumbaikers ready to play house again?

A property worth Rs 50.5 crore in the same project was registered on September 2. The size of the unit was 730.02 sq m.  Another property worth Rs 45 crore was registered on September 18.

Hero MotoCorp, which is the leader in the budget bike segment (100-110cc), is also in the process of developing electric two- wheelers for both mass and premium segments.  &amp;quot;Our strategy is to create a full portfolio of premium across segments and across engine capacity. Towards this, we already launched XPulse and Xtreme in the 200cc and 160cc segment, respectively. Over the next few years, we will continue to fill this portfolio with more and more new models,&amp;quot; Hero MotoCorp Chief Financial Officer Niranjan Gupta said in an analyst call.  The Harley-Davidson partnership accelerates and enhances the company's premium segment strategy, he added.  In September this year, Harley-Davidson announced discontinuation of sales and manufacturing operations in India, a decade after it started selling its premium bikes in the country.  In late-October, Hero MotoCorp and Harley-Davidson announced a partnership for the Indian market. As part of the deal, Hero MotoCorp will develop and sell a range of premium motorcycles under the Harley-Davidson brand name in the country. Besides, it will take care of service and parts requirements for Harley bikes.  Further, Hero MotoCorp would sell Harley accessories and general merchandise, riding gear and apparel through a network of brand-exclusive Harley-Davidson dealers and its existing sales network in the country.  &amp;quot;The partnership is going to be mutually beneficial for both the companies and the ride together in the premium segment will be definitely enriching,&amp;quot; Gupta said.

And plus we continue to develop our own product as well,&amp;quot; Gupta noted.

However, some changes had to be made to the deal following correspondence from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI).","Max Life Insurance CEO and managing director Prashant Tripathy has said that approval from the insurance regulator on Axis Bank proposal to raise its stake in the insurer to about 19 percent should come through within next three months.  Earlier in October, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) did not approve Axis Bank's proposal to raise its stake up to 29 percent but scaled it down to an aggregate of 19.02 percent with the subsidiaries of private sector lenders.  Axis Bank was to originally acquire an additional about 29 percent stake in Max Life. However, some changes had to be made to the deal following correspondence from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI).  The bank has shown its willingness to raise its stake directly and through its subsidiary in the Max Life Insurance, Tripathy said.  &amp;quot;This particular transaction in the permissible zone as per the RBI regulation, so it may not require any approval from RBI. It requires approval from IRDAI. We filed for IRDAI's approval about two weeks ago. It is under process. We should get approval in this financial year itself,&amp;quot; he told PTI.  Axis Bank currently holds about 1 percent stake in Max Life and is the biggest banking channel partner for the distribution of the insurer's products. Products sold through the bank reportedly account for 54 percent of Max Life's revenues.  Axis Bank had said its total stake in Max Life will remain within the limits stipulated under the applicable laws and regulations.  &amp;quot;Under the revised agreements, Axis Bank will acquire up to 9.002 percent of the equity share capital of Max Life, and Axis Capital Limited and Axis Securities Limited will together acquire up to 3 percent of the share capital of Max Life.  &amp;quot;In addition, Axis entities will have a right to acquire an additional stake of up to 7 percent of the equity share capital of Max Life, in one or more tranches, in accordance with existing laws and regulations,&amp;quot; the bank had said.

713,2020-12-07 07:24:15+05:30,HDFC Bank Ltd.,HDFCBANK,Hot Stocks | Force Motors and HDFC Bank are two short-term trading ideas,"We have been hovering in the overbought territory for the last 2-3 weeks, but sometimes the market does not respect the theory and hence, it can remain overbought for a long time as well.","  In the last week, trading started on a flat note on Tuesday but Nifty gradually resumed its upward trajectory to reclaim 13,000-mark first and then clocked fresh record highs as the week progressed.  There was no major movement but overall bias remained positive as we managed to add another couple of percent to the previous weekly close.  There has been no stopping for the recent rally and it&rsquo;s been more than one-and-a-half months now for the markets giving gravity-defying moves.  For the week gone by, if we look at the benchmark, we may not get the real picture of the overall action, but if we take a glance at some of the individual themes like auto, we see individual stocks have given spectacular moves throughout the week.  We have been hovering in the overbought territory for the last 2-3 weeks, but sometimes the market does not respect the theory and hence, it can remain overbought for a long time as well.  But in our sense, the optimism has now turned into a bit of euphoria and when such a condition happens, it&rsquo;s advisable to be a bit proactive and take some money off the table, especially for a momentum trader.  Undoubtedly, the broader degree trend remains strongly bullish and in case of any meaningful decline, one should stick to the &lsquo;buy on decline&rsquo; strategy.  As far as levels are concerned, 13,300 &ndash; 13,500 would be seen as an immediate resistance zone, whereas on the lower side, 13,150 &ndash; 13,100 are the levels to watch out for.  If we observe the intraday charts, we can see the formation of the &lsquo;Rising Wedge&rsquo; pattern on the hourly chart and hence, a move below 13,100 would lead to further profit booking towards 12,980 &ndash; 12,900.  Traders are advised to take note of all these key levels and act accordingly.  Here is one buy and one sell calls for the next 2-3 weeks:  Force Motors | Buy | LTP: Rs 1,262.85 | Target price: Rs 1,420 | Stop loss: Rs 1,197 | Upside: 12%  Auto was one of the few sectors which initiated a u-turn post-March fiasco. We witnessed a V-shaped recovery in the first five months (from April to August) followed by a brief pause of nearly two months.  In fact, in the week gone by, some of the stocks from this space just took off and Force Motors was one of them.  Due to the recent rally, the stock prices are back to pre-COVID levels and on the daily chart, we can see the breakout of the &lsquo;Bullish Flag&rsquo; pattern.  Volumes have been exceptional in the last couple of days&rsquo; surge and hence, we expect the stock to continue this northward journey in the near term as well.  HDFC Bank | Sell | LTP: Rs 1,390.10 | Target price: Rs 1,320 | Stop loss: Rs 1,436 | Downside: 5%  This marquee banking name is not associated with the tag of 'bearish&rsquo; along with it.  The longer-term view remains bullish but on a smaller timeframe chart, we are seeing some signs of exhaustion, which may also be interpreted as a profit-booking after a gigantic rally.  During the latter half of the week, the stock prices started sulking a bit after some unfavorable news flow.  This is getting reflected in the stock price as we can witness a slightly bigger bearish candle on the weekly chart.  In fact, on the daily timeframe, it's challenging the key 20-day EMA placed at Rs 1,380 &ndash; 1,370.  The moment we see this stock sliding below Rs 1,370, we may see extended profit-booking in this stock.

714,2020-12-07 08:52:34+05:30,Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.,MARUTI,Why did Maruti Suzuki sales fall in November 2020?,Sales fell by 2.4 percent during the month while the industry grew by 9 percent during the same month. Record low factory inventory and production shortages the factors. Company fears December figures to be even lower.,"Maruti Suzuki&nbsp;became the only carmaker in the top five category to register a drop in sales in November 2020. This came on the back of two consecutive months of robust double-digit growths. Sales of the Alto and Swift maker fell by 2.4 percent during November while the industry grew by 9 percent during the same month.  So was it demand fatigue, fierce competition or a combination of both behind the fall, which has spooked market watchers? None, as per a company official. The real reason behind the fall was due to the record low factory inventory and production shortages.  Speaking to&nbsp;Moneycontrol,&nbsp;Shashank Srivastava, executive director, marketing and sales, Maruti Suzuki India, said: &ldquo;In November, our opening stock was very low. There was very little of it because we had record dispatches in October.&rdquo;  In October 2020, Maruti Suzuki dispatched around 166,000 units, which was its highest-ever in a month. But in November, the company recorded dispatches of 135,775 units as against 139,133 units recorded in the same month in 2019.  &ldquo;What we could dispatch in November was only what we were able to produce in November. The number of working days in our factories in November were much lesser. Still, we worked at full capacity, and produced 137,000 units for the domestic market (including the light truck Super Carry) and that&rsquo;s what we dispatched,&rdquo; added Srivastava. Supply chain (auto parts availability) is still an issue in the auto industry. Plus, Diwali holidays also&nbsp;hit factory output.  Maruti's&nbsp;drop in November sales was the first since June, fuelling speculations that India&rsquo;s consumer demand revival was short-lived and largely dependent on pent-up demand created due to the lockdown. This theory was amplified when Maruti&rsquo;s mini segment comprising Alto and S-Presso recorded a fall of 15 percent in volumes during November. Following the easing of the lockdown restrictions, buyers have preferred pocket-friendly car models such as those from the mini segment to avoid taking public transport.  The retail quotient  While wholesales (company to dealers) did take a knock in November, retail (dealer to consumer) volumes remained upbeat, growing by 69 percent compared to the same month last year, claimed Srivastava.  &ldquo;Maruti Suzuki&rsquo;s market share in the retail segment is still more than 50 percent and it has remained like that, right from the start of the year. It was 45 percent in November last year. We grew our retails by 69 percent compared to last year&rsquo;s November. We sold 167,500 in November this year compared to 99,500 last year,&rdquo; added Srivastava.  Retail volumes remained high in November despite the discounts hitting a yearly low. At an estimated Rs 17,500, the average discount offered on a Maruti Suzuki car during November was the lowest since the start of the financial year. The highest discount was offered during the June quarter of Rs 25,000 per car at the wholesale level.  &ldquo;As the stocks are lower right now, one would see lower discount figures in December as it was in November. December would be even lower than November,&rdquo; added Srivastava.  How did Maruti&rsquo;s rivals fare?  Hyundai Motor India, which, like Maruti Suzuki, is also running its plants at full capacity, recorded a 9 percent growth in wholesale volumes in November.&nbsp;Tata Motors&nbsp;managed to keep up with its monthly production rate of November on par with the last few months. The Mumbai-based company doubled November wholesales compared to last year&rsquo;s November.  Kia Motors continued its upward swing, recording a 50 percent growth in wholesales followed by a 28 percent growth recorded by&nbsp;Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra. These five companies, which generate 86 percent of the industry&rsquo;s volumes, make up the top five passenger vehicle makers in India.","Auto, Business, Maruti Suzuki, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/why-did-maruti-suzuki-sales-fallnovember-2020_14559961.html

Maruti's&nbsp;drop in November sales was the first since June, fuelling speculations that India&rsquo;s consumer demand revival was short-lived and largely dependent on pent-up demand created due to the lockdown. This theory was amplified when Maruti&rsquo;s mini segment comprising Alto and S-Presso recorded a fall of 15 percent in volumes during November. Following the easing of the lockdown restrictions, buyers have preferred pocket-friendly car models such as those from the mini segment to avoid taking public transport.  The retail quotient  While wholesales (company to dealers) did take a knock in November, retail (dealer to consumer) volumes remained upbeat, growing by 69 percent compared to the same month last year, claimed Srivastava.  &ldquo;Maruti Suzuki&rsquo;s market share in the retail segment is still more than 50 percent and it has remained like that, right from the start of the year. It was 45 percent in November last year. We grew our retails by 69 percent compared to last year&rsquo;s November. We sold 167,500 in November this year compared to 99,500 last year,&rdquo; added Srivastava.  Retail volumes remained high in November despite the discounts hitting a yearly low. At an estimated Rs 17,500, the average discount offered on a Maruti Suzuki car during November was the lowest since the start of the financial year. The highest discount was offered during the June quarter of Rs 25,000 per car at the wholesale level.  &ldquo;As the stocks are lower right now, one would see lower discount figures in December as it was in November. December would be even lower than November,&rdquo; added Srivastava.  How did Maruti&rsquo;s rivals fare?  Hyundai Motor India, which, like Maruti Suzuki, is also running its plants at full capacity, recorded a 9 percent growth in wholesale volumes in November.&nbsp;Tata Motors&nbsp;managed to keep up with its monthly production rate of November on par with the last few months. The Mumbai-based company doubled November wholesales compared to last year&rsquo;s November.  Kia Motors continued its upward swing, recording a 50 percent growth in wholesales followed by a 28 percent growth recorded by&nbsp;Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra. These five companies, which generate 86 percent of the industry&rsquo;s volumes, make up the top five passenger vehicle makers in India.","Auto, Business, Maruti Suzuki, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/why-did-maruti-suzuki-sales-fallnovember-2020_14559961.html

The topics of discussion constituted (a) how the management is trying to build a strong bank with best-in-class digital capabilities, (b) using technology to accelerate growth across business verticals and maintaining healthy operating metrics, (c) focusing on identifying potential micro markets for expansion, (d) strong demand recovery in consumption loans, with disbursements in secured loans surpassing pre-COVID levels, and (e) how asset quality has remained resilient, with the bank maintaining one of the highest coverages among private banks. ICICI Bank has historically been a technology-savvy bank and has several innovations to its credit. However, systemic asset quality concerns have taken the center-stage and diverted investor focus away from the strong digital capabilities/innovations built by the bank. New digital innovations have positioned the bank well to gain incremental market share across key product lines. ICICIBC carries an additional provision buffer of 1.3% of loans, besides robust PCR. It has suggested in the past that corporate restructuring is likely to account for less than 100bp of loans. Outlook The bank expects credit cost to normalize fully in FY22E, which would accelerate earnings growth. We estimate FY22/FY23 RoA at 1.5%/1.7%, enabling the bank to deliver FY23E RoE of 15.2%.

Each site will have access to a cohort of about 50,000 to 100,000 healthy volunteers, who can be tracked for prolonged periods of time.  The government has upgraded the infrastructure at these sites, trained the staff extensively on good clinical practices (GCP), harmonised protocols and ensured that participants are communicated in local languages. In addition, the government is also setting up a network of laboratories for immunogencity testing, based on globally recognised assays. The entire exercise was funded under the National Biopharma Mission at Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC).  Immunogenecity testing means measuring antibodies specifically generated against the vaccine.  During the COVID-19 vaccine development process, makers from countries&nbsp;such as&nbsp;the US and the UK took the lead, as they have a long history of new drug development and experience of running large multi-centre late-stage clinical trials, with the ability to quickly recruit thousands of participants in a short span of time. In India, where drug discovery is very nascent, it was a challenge to identify good clinical trial sites&nbsp;that can recruit a large number of people. This is where the government stepped in.  In the first phase, six trial sites have been added; these are INCLEN Trust International, Palwal, Haryana; KEM, Pune; ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology, Tiruneleveli; Christian Medical College, Vellore and Societiy for Health Allied Research Education (SHARE), Hyderabad. Another five clinical trial sites were added later such as Maulana Azad Medical College, Delhi; Society for Applied Studies, Delhi; INCLEN Trust International, Shillong, Meghalaya; ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneshwar, Odisha; Andhra Medical College, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh; and Pondicherry Institute of Medical Sciences, Pondicherry.  DBT said 11 sites are scattered across the country covering the diverse population groups of India, including urban, rural and tribal segments.  Moreover,&nbsp;the DBT also created a cohort of 5,000 subjects at each of the sites to follow up on them for a year, to study immunological response to disease like COVID, Dengue and Chikungunya.  In addition, a vaccine expert committee under DBT meets every two weeks. It provides scientific and technical inputs to research groups and vaccine developers to help them meet regulatory requirements with the DCGI.  &amp;quot;Vaccine development is a complex journey&nbsp;that requires a lot of scientific input as we move on.&nbsp;We need to make sure that&nbsp;quality data is generated that meets the regulatory requirement of not just India but globally,&amp;quot; said Renu Swarup, DBT Secretary and BIRAC Chairperson.  Dr Reddy's earlier announced that it&nbsp;was receiving advisory support from DBT for the clinical trials of Russia&rsquo;s Sputnik V vaccine. Dr Reddy's is doing a phase-2 trial of Sputnik V vaccine in India.&nbsp;The company will be using BIRAC&rsquo;s clinical trial centres for testing the vaccine.","Business, Companies, coronavirus, Health","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/viswanath-pilla-6848/', 'name': 'Viswanath Pilla'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/this-is-how-dbt-is-helping-companies-accelerate-developmentcovid-19-vaccine_14563021.html

731,2020-12-08 17:10:01+05:30,Bharti Airtel Ltd.,BHARTIARTL,India specific 5G standard an existential threat: Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal,Gopal Vittal said that there is a need to create an India open ecosystem and promote applications developed for India and by India.,"The idea to develop India specific 5G standard is an existential threat and will lock the country out of the global ecosystem, a senior Bharti Airtel official said on Tuesday.  The official also said the development of a separate 5G standard will impact innovation.  &amp;quot;There are sometimes talks that India must have its own 5G standard. This is an existential threat which could lock India out of the global ecosystem and slow down the pace of innovation. We could have let our citizens down if you allow that to happen,&rdquo; Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal said while speaking at virtual India Mobile Congress 2020.  The statement from Vittal followed a speech by RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani at the event, where he mentioned that Jio&rsquo;s 5G network &amp;quot;will be powered by indigenous-developed network, hardware and technology components&rdquo;.  Jio has sought spectrum in certain frequencies from the Department of Telecom for holding trials of the latest 5G technology.  The company&rsquo;s wholly-owned US-based subsidiary Radisys has already started selling some of the 5G solutions to foreign companies. Vittal said India should have an open ecosystem. He cited examples of CDMA and GSM to push his case.  &amp;quot;CDMA was better technology, but GSM won because it was more accepted technology. More companies in the world embraced GSM. GSM won because it became part of the global ecosystem and CDMA died,&rdquo; he added.  He said that there is a need to create an India open ecosystem and promote applications developed for India and by India.  &amp;quot;For this we have to come together. We have to set aside our differences and be part of one. Telcos, equipment players, device players, manufacturing companies, IT companies. Everyone can benefit as the globe of technology makes it all more productive,&rdquo; Vittal said.  He called for enabling a policy environment that keeps access to affordable technology.  &amp;quot;&hellip;If we as a country can embrace global standards, create an open ecosystem for India and leverage this to reimagine our businesses by having a single and predictable policy environment, the entrepreneurial energy of India will develop digital India,&rdquo; Vittal said.  He had earlier said that the company will refrain from bidding for 5G spectrum if the reserve price is high.  Regulator Trai has recommended a price of Rs 492 crore per Mhz for spectrum in the 3,300-3,600 Mhz band which is considered suitable for 5G services at present.  Telecom operators interested in buying radiowaves for 5G services will have to shell out a minimum of Rs 9,840 crore on pan-India basis to buy spectrum in the 3,300-3,600 Mhz band as Trai has suggested that it should be put to auction in the block size of 20 MHz.  Earlier also, Airtel had said that it will not bid for this spectrum at the Trai-recommended price as companies will need to shell out about Rs 50,000 crore to acquire a decent quantity of frequencies in this band.

","India&rsquo;s top five carmakers have tightened their stranglehold over the passenger vehicle (PV) market, expanding their footprint to cover&nbsp;85&nbsp;percent of the pie, leaving 22 other brands jostling for a slice of the remaining 15 percent.  Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai,&nbsp;Tata Motors, Kia Motors and&nbsp;Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra&nbsp;dominate the PV segment despite the presence of large, recognised global brands such as Renault, Ford, Honda, Toyota and Volkswagen.  Data shared by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA) show that the top five companies improved their share this year by&nbsp;4.5 percentage points&nbsp;till November from the&nbsp;81.56 percent&nbsp;clocked by them in November last year.  For a large market (India is the fourth largest automotive market in the world) such a lack of fragmentation in the market share is unique. For instance, in China, which is the world&rsquo;s largest automotive market, the top five carmakers control only 40 percent of the market and in the US, their share stands at 68 percent. As for Germany, which was overtaken by India last year, the top five carmakers commanded a 50 percent share.  Japan remains an exception to the list with nearly 81 percent of the market controlled by the top five companies, all of which are Japanese brands. Toyota, a dominant brand in many countries, has a share of just 3 percent in India.  New launches and brand loyalty helped India&rsquo;s top five carmakers to improve their market share. Though Maruti Suzuki, the country&rsquo;s largest carmaker, did not have any new model launches during the year so far, the company still managed to improve its retail share.  How they fared  A senior Maruti official said the company increased its market share to more than 50 percent in November from the 45 percent recorded in November last year. &ldquo;Maruti&rsquo;s low-cost models, strong brand recall and wider network helped it gain market share during the last few months. People tend to fall back on tried and tested brands during trying times,&rdquo; said a senior Mumbai-based analyst.  Hyundai recorded a slight decline in retail market share to 16.21 percent in November from the 17.74 percent clocked in November 2019. Tata Motors recorded the second biggest rise in retail market share in November to 7.5 percent, from 4.84 percent, while Kia Motors logged the best improvement in share to 6.28 percent from 3.78 percent.  Tata Motors&rsquo; pre-lockdown launch Altroz and SUV Nexon helped it improve its share. As for Kia Motors, the compact SUV Sonet, which has gone on to become the best-seller in its segment, helped it widen market share.  Tata Motors reclaimed the third spot a few months ago &mdash; Kia had raced to number three&nbsp;in March but is currently in the fourth spot.  Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra, India&rsquo;s fifth largest PV maker, suffered the worst fall in November in its peer group. From 6.78 percent, M&amp;amp;amp;M&rsquo;s market share in the retail PV space fell to 5.48 percent during the month.  M&amp;amp;amp;M&rsquo;s fall came on the back of the much-publicised robust response it received for the Thar SUV. Within a month of its launch M&amp;amp;amp;M claims that the Thar received 20,000 bookings.

APE refers to 100 percent of regular premiums collected and 10 percent of single premium collection.  The report said the APE increase of 14 percent YoY in October 2020 was on the back of a high base.    The country's largest insurer Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) reported high growth of 104 percent in individual APE during November 2019 due to sunset period of some of its key policies. On this high base, LIC reported 54 percent&nbsp;decline in November 2020.  Among private insurers, HDFC Life, Max Life and Tata AIA performed better than the industry while ICICI Prudential Life and Aditya Birla Sun Life were weak.  Other insurers like SBI Life and Bajaj Allianz Life were broadly in line with industry averages. The Kotak report said that equity mutual funds reported sharp outflows likely due to profit booking.    Among the different business segments, the share of single premium dropped to 47 percent in November 2020 from 50 percent in October 2020. The Kotak report said the marginal decline in share of single premiums likely&nbsp;indicates some moderation in pace of growth of annuity or lump sum payout products.    In the group business, the private players&rsquo; market share in group business was broadly flat&nbsp;month-on-month&nbsp;at 24 percent in November&nbsp;2020.

736,2020-12-11 12:23:21+05:30,Hero MotoCorp Ltd.,HEROMOTOCO,Visible trends of recovery bring the auto sector on investors' radar; should you buy?,"Global brokerage firm CLSA, as per CNBC-TV18, expects the passenger vehicle (PV) segment to outperform in FY22. It has increased FY21-23 PV forecasts by 7-9 percent and for two-wheelers (2Ws) by 1-3 percent.","Thanks to the visible trends of recovery, most analysts and brokerages are positive on the auto sector.  Markets have come a long way after the outbreak of COVID-19 triggered a massive selloff in March 2020 and most sectors are now at pre-COVID levels.  While there are pockets of opportunities in many sectors, the auto has come into focus owing to the positive outlook on the rural economy and a shift towards personal mobility.  Brokerages point out after witnessing a severe impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, demand is returning at a pace faster than originally expected.  Global brokerage firm CLSA, as per CNBC-TV18, expects the passenger vehicle (PV) segment to outperform in FY22. It has increased FY21-23 PV forecasts by 7-9 percent and for two-wheelers (2Ws) by 1-3 percent.  The brokerage underscored that PV outperformance has resulted in healthier inventory levels.  However, the brokerage flags concerns of rich valuations of auto stocks at this juncture.  CLSA believes the current valuations limit the potential upside. It has downgraded Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto to 'outperform' from 'buy'.  It has raised the target price for Bajaj Auto to Rs 3,750 from Rs 3,575 while for Hero MotoCorp, it has raised the target price to Rs 3,600 from Rs 3,500.  CLSA has maintained outperform on TVS Motor and 'sell' on Maruti and Eicher. For TVS Motor, it has raised the target price to Rs 530 from Rs 460.  The target for Maruti is raised to Rs 7,120 from Rs 6,300 by the brokerage. CLSA has raised the target price for Eicher to Rs 2,255 from Rs 2,000.  Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services is overweight on plays on rural markets and global PVs.  Motilal Oswal expects demand momentum to sustain in the foreseeable future, driven by normalisation of supply-side factors (finance, supply chain, systemic inventory, etc) as well as improving rural markets and recovery in urban markets.  However, the brokerage firm empahsised that the divergent stock performance vis-&agrave;-vis the NSE Auto index highlights the need for an active stock selection strategy, especially considering the numerous sub-segments within the sector with highly varied driving forces.  &amp;quot;We have an overweight stance on auto as we believe we are just at the start of the recovery cycle following the last two years of unprecedented weakness,&amp;quot; said Motilal Oswal.  &amp;quot;With a good performance post the restart, we prefer companies with higher visibility on volume growth, external as well as internal drivers for earnings, and reasonable valuations.&amp;quot;  The brokerage firm is overweight on plays on the rural economy (Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra, Hero MotoCorp) and global PV segment (Tata Motors, Motherson Sumi).  The brokerage is underweight on India PV (Maruti Suzuki) and 2Ws (Bajaj Auto, Eicher Motors and TVS).

The Grit strategy continues to focus on the core method of LTI: understand client business and identify areas for improvement and solve problems. LTI sees Cloud biz. as a $1Bn opportunity in next 3 years and has setup dedicated SBU for top 3 Hyperscalers (Reached Tier 1 status in all major cloud scalers) and now plans to target beyond F2000 clients as well (as evident from its recent deal in UAE).

This unit will have different go-to-market so that the Data-services team have their independent choice of using the relevant product for client (internal or external).

Given a similar strategy being adopted by large-cap peers like TCS and INFO, we view this as a positional play by the company in addition to the growth opportunity. Creating separate teams to focus on the top three hyperscalers, along with Cloud reference models for the sub-industry should help LTI benefit from a multi-year Cloud migration opportunity. While we see new BUs as positive from an overall positioning, we are still unsure of the business potential from a standalone basis given the limited success across the industry from products in the past.

","The pandemic due to COVID-19 has ushered in an inflection point in the entire banking system&nbsp;which is going to bring in radical changes in terms of lending parameters, MD and CEO of Axis Bank Amitabh Chaudhary said on December 11.  Speaking at a session on financial system organised by XLRI, he said that the COVID crisis has created a huge disruption in the banking system in the country where individual banks are feeling its impact. He said that due to the pandemic, individuals ability to repay loans has reduced significantly while 90 percent of the banks' books is in moratorium.  &amp;quot;The crisis has increased the health costs and the average individual household needs money while banks at the&nbsp;same time will have to be more cautious. A vicious negative cycle has set in while discretionary spending has hit an all&nbsp;time low&amp;quot;, Chaudhary said.  At Axis, he said the bank has been able to raise capital to provide comfort to the depositors while the provision coverage ratio has gone up from 70 per cent to 124&nbsp;per cent. Chaudhary said that the bank had also been modernising its monitoring aspects leading to fall in GNPA and NNPA levels.  According to him, the banking system will have to opt for more granular mode using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) which will form the basis of lending decisions.  Chaudhary also said that data points like credit card payments and salary pay-outs will also be used for taking a lending decision. This, he said, will be supplemented by robust underwriting, also determine the long-term survival potential of the sectors and also look at the history of the promoters who are seeking loans.  Chaudhary said Axis bank had activated its quick response team before the crisis surfaced in India looking at the experience of China.  He also said that for the first time, stress is building up in the retail sector putting the banks in a&nbsp;precarious situation which will have an impact on the price of loans and interest rates.

Deputy Insolvency and Companies Court Judge Robert Schaffer declined to allow a draw down from the court-held funds of an estimated amount of around 1.5 million pounds, accrued from the sale of Mallya's French luxury property Le Grand Jardin earlier this year, until further arguments in the case. However, he did allow the release of 240,000 pounds plus VAT to cover the legal costs of a substantive hearing in the bankruptcy proceedings scheduled for next Friday.  In essence, I will adjourn this hearing subject to one caveat that the fees for the hearing next week are covered, concluded Judge Schaffer, during a hearing held remotely on Friday. Mallya's counsel, Philip Marshall, had argued that his client needed urgent access to the substantial funds held by the court to cover his living and legal expenses, as had already been set out by a validation order of the High Court from last year.  Unless the court grants a validation order, prospectively or retrospectively, any payments made whilst a bankruptcy petition is pending are void. With ongoing proceedings in India and the UK, Dr Mallya cannot wait for something to live on and to cover his legal expenses. With substantial sums outstanding [to lawyers] and no other source of income, it is absurd to refuse, argued Marshall, warning that without the money Mallya would not have any legal representation for the important hearing next week.  That would put him at a very serious disadvantage and be a denial of justice, he said. The court heard that 64-year-old Mallya's income from two consultancy agreements was no longer coming in and therefore he had to resort to the money derived from the sale of his French property, which was deposited with the court as a convenient place to put the money.  Barrister Marcia Shekerdemian, arguing on behalf of SBI and others in the class action, disputed the grounds of the urgent application as being based on a pre-approved 2019 court validation order. The [2019] order dealt with payments out of his [Mallya's] income. This [application] is referring to payments out of capital assets, which is a very different animal, said Shekerdemian.  It is a substantial portion of his admitted UK assets and even on a limited urgency basis, cannot be approved, she said, accusing Mallya of trying to jump the queue to gain access to the funds before the substantive hearing in the bankruptcy case next week. The SBI-led consortium of 13 Indian banks, which also includes Bank of Baroda, Corporation Bank, Federal Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu &amp;amp;amp; Kashmir Bank, Punjab &amp;amp;amp; Sind Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of Mysore, UCO Bank, United Bank of India and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co.

Apart from a separate business unit (BU) for Cloud, the company also have a new BU for products. The reports by brokerage firms Motilal Oswal and ICICI Securities were based on the Analyst Day conference with the LTI management.  In addition, LTI is a Tier I partner for many hyper scalars and nearly half of its existing client base works with the company on cloud-related engagements. This is the opportunity the company is looking to tap into. Current revenues from cloud stands at $185 million.  According to Motilal Oswal and ICICI Securities, to achieve the $1 billion revenue, LTI has already carved out a separate business unit for each of the cloud service provider and aims to take them to new clients.  The company is currently building a separate team of cloud specialists to bring best expertise in the work. LTI will also create labs to research on the newer features of cloud.  Sudheer Guntupalli and Hardik Sangani, research analysts, ICICI Securities, said in a note that the $1 billion revenue is too ambitious. &ldquo;LTI&rsquo;s aspirations for $1bn in cloud revenue in three years implies close to 78 percent segmental CAGR. (It is) too ambitious, we do not construe this as formal guidance,&rdquo; they added.  However, Guntupalli and Sangani, said the separate BU for products presents a good option on grounds commercial success of similar products in the market and LTI&rsquo;s execution strategy.  The product business will help&nbsp;clients make sense of data generated by moving to Cloud.&nbsp;This would be done through its five key products and also SaaS version of those products to reach larger audience.  ICICI Securities note said these&nbsp;five products, which are built around data, include Decisions, ML Logistics, Agnitio, Marketplace, and Leni. These will be taken to market.  &ldquo;Management hinted at investments in engineering, R&amp;amp;amp;D, sales, and marketing of these products,&rdquo; the report said.

Pointing out that the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are constrained today in terms of cash flows, time gap in realising receivables, among others and also the level of lenders' confidence in funding them, Khara said collaborating is a better model than lending directly to MSMEs.  &amp;quot;The fact of the matter is that today not many NBFCs have come in this space. And of late, when it comes to finding solutions, we feel that apart from lending directly to the MSMEs, there is a way forward in terms of collaborating with these NBFCs along with the biggest fintechs who have the ability to process the structured and unstructured (financial) data to have a better sense in terms of assessment of risk,&amp;quot; Khara said.  Based on that assessment, he said, bankers feel very comfortable in lending to the MSMEs.  He was speaking at a webinar on financing the unfinanced organised by the Global Alliance for Mass Entrepreneurship (GAME).  There could also be another option of financing based on the cash flow and not on the basis of balance sheet because very often it is observed that the balance sheet and the financial statement are not available in a form which is expected by any banker, he added.  Also, there is a broad spectrum of MSMEs in the country which work in a host of areas and often the kind of financial information coming from them is not very organised, Khara explained.  So to the extent where the data is fully organised, which is more like any other large corporate, it is the kind of spectrum which SBI is engaging with, he said.  &amp;quot;So for different levels of maturity of MSMEs, the comfort level with the bank also differs. If at all they are part of the ecosystem for a large industry major, it becomes all the more easier for the banks to get the information structured vis-a-vis unstructured relating to the (financial) dealings (of the borrower).  &amp;quot;And those who are essentially in the nano category, may be say up to Rs 2 crore or so (turnover), there we actually tend to leverage upon various fintechs who are engaging with these MSMEs. So we would rather collaborate with such fintechs and do the co-origination model (of lending),&amp;quot; Khara said.  He further said that SBI is looking at this kind of a spectrum in financing the small businesses.  &amp;quot;So this is the kind of spectrum and this is how we actually intend to operate. It may not be out of place to mention that many of the MSMEs are still having lots of business done on cash.  &amp;quot;So I think that is posing a major challenge because it is not really giving enough insight into their (financial) behaviour and naturally it is not giving any insight into their turnover,&amp;quot; said the SBI chairman.  He said the country's largest lender will be happy to deal with the intermediary players in the financing business and may be &amp;quot;we can help such intermediary players by buying out their portfolio also&amp;quot;.  The recently launched scheme where banks can also finance some kind of sweat equity is also another option, he added.  &amp;quot;So I think we have got the whole gamut of solutions which are available, but all said and done so as the equity is concerned I think that is something, the sweat equity, which is something wanted by the MSMEs to bring in. Of course in the recent past a new scheme has been introduced where we can also finance some kind of sweat equity also, but that is just the beginning,&amp;quot; Khara said.

Volume restriction for each player would be capped at 10% of total Revlimid volume for initial years and gradually increase till CY25E, while launch date will be in the order of settlement done. We value Revilmid benefit using NPV method as competitive environment could be fast changing with few more similar settlement agreements for launch post Mar-CY22E. We assume CIPLA to capture market share of 5%/7%/10%/12% over FY23/24/25/26E with price erosion of 40-65% which translates into Rs41bn of NPV and Rs51/per share. Our assumption for core business remains unchanged and we value CIPLA on FY23E and assign 22x(Unchanged) PE on core business while we include Rs51/share (assigning 1x(PE) benefit from Revlimid over FY23-26E using NPV method.

In an interview with&nbsp;Moneycontrol,&nbsp;Akram Pasha, the Labour Commissioner, said: &ldquo;We met with the workers of Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) today. We have declared that the strike and the lockout are illegal.&rdquo;  On November 13, TKM had suspended 39 members of the union, who, it alleges, were involved in acts of misconduct. They were placed under suspension, pending enquiry. Prior to this, Toyota had declared a lockout at both its plants, located in Bidadi, Karnataka, after the workers called a strike following the suspension of the union&rsquo;s treasurer early in November.  TKM lifted the lockout on November 19 on State government orders but four days later the company recommenced the lockout after members of the union prevented workers from resuming duty. &ldquo;The workers were convinced to lift the lockdown and start working,&rdquo; Pasha added.  On December 4, TKM began running the plants with limited capacity though the management had earlier reasoned that a minimum of 90 percent of the workforce was required to plant operations smoothly.  Moneycontrol&nbsp;is awaiting Toyota Kirloskar&rsquo;s comments on the development.  The union, which claims to have the backing of 3,500 workers, is seeking the revocation of the suspension of the suspended employees. A source close to the development said there is merely an 'ego clash' between the workers and management and there are no labour law violations.  Two of Toyota&rsquo;s three in-demand products &mdash; Glanza and Urban Cruiser &mdash;&nbsp;are not even made at the two Karnataka plants. These are sourced from Suzuki Motor Corporation and&nbsp;Maruti Suzuki India&nbsp;from Gujarat and Haryana, respectively. As of October-end, both models accounted for nearly 50 percent of Toyota&rsquo;s sales in India.  On November 24, TKM introduced the facelifted Innova Crysta. The launch came just a day after the company decided to withdraw the lockout, effective November 19.  The Innova Crysta, which accounts for 36 percent of its India sales, continues to be produced in limited numbers from one of the plants. The Yaris, Camry Hybrid and Fortuner are the other models manufactured by Toyota in India. Sources said that only around 100 vehicles were being made at the plants. Vellfire, a premium multi-seater, is a fully imported model. These four models account for about 15 percent of TKM&rsquo;s India sales.","Auto, Business, Technology, Toyota Kirloskar","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6837/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/karnataka-labour-department-declares-toyota-kirloskar-worker-strikecompany-lockout-illegal_14578541.html

In an interview with&nbsp;Moneycontrol,&nbsp;Akram Pasha, the Labour Commissioner, said: &ldquo;We met with the workers of Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) today. We have declared that the strike and the lockout are illegal.&rdquo;  On November 13, TKM had suspended 39 members of the union, who, it alleges, were involved in acts of misconduct. They were placed under suspension, pending enquiry. Prior to this, Toyota had declared a lockout at both its plants, located in Bidadi, Karnataka, after the workers called a strike following the suspension of the union&rsquo;s treasurer early in November.  TKM lifted the lockout on November 19 on State government orders but four days later the company recommenced the lockout after members of the union prevented workers from resuming duty. &ldquo;The workers were convinced to lift the lockdown and start working,&rdquo; Pasha added.  On December 4, TKM began running the plants with limited capacity though the management had earlier reasoned that a minimum of 90 percent of the workforce was required to plant operations smoothly.  Moneycontrol&nbsp;is awaiting Toyota Kirloskar&rsquo;s comments on the development.  The union, which claims to have the backing of 3,500 workers, is seeking the revocation of the suspension of the suspended employees. A source close to the development said there is merely an 'ego clash' between the workers and management and there are no labour law violations.  Two of Toyota&rsquo;s three in-demand products &mdash; Glanza and Urban Cruiser &mdash;&nbsp;are not even made at the two Karnataka plants. These are sourced from Suzuki Motor Corporation and&nbsp;Maruti Suzuki India&nbsp;from Gujarat and Haryana, respectively. As of October-end, both models accounted for nearly 50 percent of Toyota&rsquo;s sales in India.  On November 24, TKM introduced the facelifted Innova Crysta. The launch came just a day after the company decided to withdraw the lockout, effective November 19.  The Innova Crysta, which accounts for 36 percent of its India sales, continues to be produced in limited numbers from one of the plants. The Yaris, Camry Hybrid and Fortuner are the other models manufactured by Toyota in India. Sources said that only around 100 vehicles were being made at the plants. Vellfire, a premium multi-seater, is a fully imported model. These four models account for about 15 percent of TKM&rsquo;s India sales.","Auto, Business, Technology, Toyota Kirloskar","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6837/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/karnataka-labour-department-declares-toyota-kirloskar-worker-strikecompany-lockout-illegal_14578541.html

758,2020-12-15 09:54:47+05:30,Tata Motors Ltd.,TATAMOTORS,Daimler to launch India's first electric truck,"While several commercial vehicle makers have launched fully electric buses on Indian roads, no manufacturer has shown interest in launching electric trucks. If it succeeds, Daimler will have the first mover&rsquo;s advantage. The company says it will detail the plan at its Future Mobility event next year  ","Daimler, the heavy-duty truck and bus maker, is planning to launch India's first electric truck as it continues to bet on the domestic market.  The German auto giant, which makes medium and heavy trucks and buses under the BharatBenz and Fuso brands, is scheduled to have an event next year titled &lsquo;Future Mobility&rsquo;. A Daimler India Commercial Vehicle (DICV) official said the company would reveal its plans for the electric truck at the event.  Last week, at the FICCI annual general meeting, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said: &ldquo;I had an interaction with the managing director of Mercedes-Benz. He was telling me they are planning to launch an electric truck.&rdquo;  The brand Mercedes-Benz, which is popularly associated with luxury vehicles, belongs to Daimler AG. Daimler&rsquo;s commercial vehicle division also uses the three-pointed star logo on its trucks.  The government is keen to cut down oil imports and make India a global manufacturing hub for electric vehicles.  For the international market Daimler is on course to launch a fully-electric truck in 2021.  The light-duty Fuso eCanter is the first all-electric truck from Daimler Trucks for series production and its second-generation version will be launched next year. The eCanter has a drive range of 100 km and can carry a payload of up to 3,200 kg.  Daimler has been at the forefront with regards to introduction of new technology in India. It was the only company to have launched Bharat Stage 5 (BS-V) trucks in India even though there was no such requirement as manufacturers were asked to jump from BS-IV to BS-VI.  On the road not taken  If Daimler launches an electric truck in India it could get the first-mover advantage. While several commercial vehicle makers have launched fully electric buses on Indian roads, no manufacturer has shown much interest in replicating this for trucks.  Home-grown commercial vehicle heavyweights such as&nbsp;Tata Motors, VE Commercial Vehicles,&nbsp;Ashok Leyland&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra&nbsp;have either delivered fully electric buses to buyers or are working on developing such vehicles for launch in the coming years.  Other companies, with the backing of Chinese firms such as BYD and Beiqi Foton, have also bagged large orders to supply electric buses to Indian transporters.  Staying the course  Despite a fall of 36 percent in wholesale volumes during 2019 to just under 14,500 units, DICV has refused to take its foot off the pedal as far as investments are concerned. The Chennai-based CV maker signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of Tamil Nadu in May this year covering a further investment of Rs 2,277 crore.  The investments are designed to expand CV production at the Oragadam plant. This investment represents the creation of around 400 jobs. DICV&rsquo;s retail volumes stood at just under 15,200 units, down 29 percent from 2018.  The company&rsquo;s market share in the over-9-tonne category slipped slightly to 5.8 percent&nbsp;in 2019 from the 6 percent clocked in 2018. In its own submission, the company said this was its worst market share in five years.","Auto, Business, Daimler, Electric Vehicle, EV, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/daimler-to-launch-india39s-first-electric-truck_14579901.html

The conversation on Day 1 of the two-day Facebook-hosted event revolved around opportunities in India, the way digital can accelerate economic progress, and how small businesses will be a key part of the global recovery going forward.  Read the full transcript of the conversation between Mukesh Ambani and Mark Zuckerberg below:&nbsp;  Mark Zuckerberg: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I am sorry that we can't do this together in person, but we're excited to host the first-ever Facebook Fuel event in India. India is a very special and important country for us. Millions of people here use our products every day to stay in touch with friends and family. Whether it's a WhatsApp message, or a Facebook post, or photos on Instagram. And millions of small businesses across the country use WhatsApp business and Messenger to reach customers, manage orders, and grow their businesses. And in fact, we actually test some of our new features here first, before rolling them out globally. And speaking of tests, we just announced that we are hosting India&rsquo;s tour of Australia on demand on Facebook Watch. I am not exactly a sports guy myself, but I understand that that's quite a big deal here. And what I do know is that India is home to a lot of incredibly talented people. Now we see that in the folks that we recruit in our offices, both in India and at our headquarters, back in California. But this is more than just about Facebook because what happens in India here is important for the whole world as well. Prime Minister Modi's Digital India Vision, has opened up opportunities for the industry to partner with the government to accelerate growth and development through technology. And India is building local capabilities and tech capacity, to power innovative new business models and provide Indian citizens access to digital and financial inclusion. So, decisions that are made here, shape the global discussion about how technology can drive more economic opportunity and better outcomes for people. And a lot of Indian organizations are leading the way, and using technology to build safer communities and more inclusive financial systems. Whether it's in social commerce, or education or financial services, there is a lot of innovation that happens here, and we are proud to partner with some of the teams that are working on these important challenges. There's a very entrepreneurial culture here, that's quite remarkable. It's a great example of how access to better tools can unlock more opportunity for people, and we see that not just in the tech start-up scene, but millions and millions of small businesses that recognize the value that all these tools can provide. So, at Facebook, we like to say that we are in the business of serving small businesses. And nowhere is this more true than in India. This is especially important because small businesses here will be a key part of the global recovery going forward. And we are focused on making sure we build the best tools for them. So, this is part of a much broader conversation about how we can all make sure that tech delivers for everyone. And that's one of the reasons why we wanted to partner with Jio, which has played such a key role in giving hundreds of millions of Indians access to the benefits of the internet, everything that it can provide, and fostering this entrepreneurial culture. And with that, I am really glad to welcome Mukesh Ambani, the Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries, to talk about where things stand in terms of the country's digital transformation, and what we should expect in the years ahead. Mukesh, thank you very much for being here and let's get started.  Mukesh Ambani: Mark, first of all, congratulations to you and your team for organizing this Facebook Fuel for India event. I am sure this event will provide a lot of fuel of ideas to fire India&rsquo;s growth engine as you just described. The most powerful idea that can propel India&rsquo;s growth is that young people can create great enterprises and new businesses. And all the young Indian people see an inspiring young icon in Mark Zuckerberg. They are motivated when they see how in just 14 years, Facebook has become the face of a digitally connected India. So, let me begin by conveying my best wishes to the success of your dreams for India, Indians, and small Indian businesses.  Mark Zuckerberg: Thank you, I appreciate that. You know, so maybe today we should start with a topic that I know is top of mind for a lot of us, that is COVID-19 and the impact that it has had on all of our lives and communities. So, I am curious from your perspective, how is India doing right now? And when do you expect things are going to return to normal? And I know that Reliance has taken a number of big steps to help the community and help the country, and it's been a big year for you. So I am curious to hear, how did your company adapt to help move forward in the midst of this pandemic?  Mukesh Ambani: The sheer magnitude of COVID-19 pandemic, like everybody else in the world, did startle all of us in India. But then I think it is not in India&rsquo;s DNA to be deterred by a crisis. I firmly believe that a crisis is too precious to be wasted. Every crisis presents an opportunity for new growth, and India has faced the COVID crisis with enormous resilience and resolve. Prime Minister Modi has led India from the front, and while we are not as rich a country as some of our western counterparts, being fiscally prudent, he has taken steps to take care of our vulnerable. We have given free food for right up to December of this year, to over 800 million Indians. 200 million citizens in India are getting direct cash transfer of Rs. 1500 in their bank account - that is the digitally connected India. And now we are ready and pretty much at par with the world, to roll out one of the largest vaccine programs in the first half of 2021, under Prime Minister's leadership. We at Reliance and Reliance Foundation, have also taken steps. As you know, Reliance has over 350,000 employees across the length and breadth of India and we have taken steps to protect over 2 million in our family and the community around them. In Mumbai, we have built a hospital just dedicated to COVID-19. We have Life Sciences as part of our business, so we have tested up early on - we have really ramped up testing, and we believe that testing helped in tracing and isolation, and at least reduced fatalities in our communities to a very low level. We have produced PPEs. We are in the textile business in Reliance, and India did not have&hellip;we used to import all our protective gear from the external world. In a matter of months, we at Reliance, produced a hundred thousand PPE's, and we are now exporters from India and this happened during the COVID time. And most importantly in the early days, when we were little stuck, we at the Reliance Foundation, distributed 55 million, one of the largest meal distribution programs for the vulnerable, in all the states and villages. So, we have played our part. And as far as Jio is concerned, we had our own dedicated team. And I could tell you that, we had never imagined that we would all work from home and the network traffic grew multiple percentage and none of us stepped out. But we could maintain 99% availability, so that Indians could work from home, shop from home, study from home, and remain connected to the rest of the world. You know, Mark, sometimes I wonder that if the pandemic had struck India just four or five years earlier, we would not have been in as good a shape as what we are today, with all the connectivity we have. The credit for that must go to our Prime Minister's Digital India vision, where he motivated the entire industry to roll out broadband in the first five years of his first term. And during the pandemic, India has attracted the largest foreign direct investment in its history. Mark, we have our own example of how Jio and Facebook concluded our partnership right in the middle of lockdown. And let me tell you with utmost sincerity, that we at Reliance and Jio, immensely value our partnership with Facebook. Thank you for your faith in Jio. Thank you, Mark, for your faith in India. I have no hesitation in going on record, that it is your investment that set the ball rolling. Not only for Jio but for the Indian FDI which has been the largest-ever in its history. And our partnership between Jio and Facebook will actually demonstrate that it is great for India, Indians, and small Indian businesses. And I believe Mark, that our actions will speak louder than our words in the coming months and years.  Mark Zuckerberg: Thank you. So, you know, one of the big opportunities that I see with this Facebook and Jio partnership is the role that we can play together in supporting the millions of small businesses in India, especially now with the impact that COVID is having, in accelerating the move of businesses from physical storefronts to digital ones in this digital future. So, I am curious what role do you see technology playing in this post-COVID world, especially as it relates to all of these small businesses. I know you share a passion with me that it is just critical that we serve them.  Mukesh Ambani: Absolutely, Mark. And let me point out a very unique feature about our partnership. Perhaps not many people have understood this. Because, before this partnership I believe that each one of us was mainly a communication platform. Together, we now have become a value creation platform for our customers and small businesses. And I firmly believe that technology, all the digitisation steps that India has taken will democratise wealth and value creation for individuals and small businesses. And let me explain this very simply. WhatsApp has hundreds of millions of subscribers in India. Jio has hundreds of millions of subscribers in India. Jio Mart, which is our retail service, has the aspiration of serving tens of millions of small shopkeepers in India, who are the bedrock of employment. So what does this mean? This means Jio brings digital connectivity, WhatsApp now with WhatsApp Pay brings digital interactivity, and the ability to move to close transactions and create value and Jio Mart brings the unmatched online and offline retail opportunity, that gives our small shops which exist in villages and small towns in India, a chance to digitize and be at par with anybody else in the world. To my mind, more wealth creation means more employment and more business. And together with our platforms and the tools that we will provide to small businesses and to individual consumers, I believe will drive India to a 5 trillion economy and will make a much more equal India, with more equal wealth growth at the bottom of the pyramid. You know, Mark, I firmly believe that in the next two decades, India will grow to be among the top three economies in the world. But more importantly, it will become a premier digital society. It will be a modern society with young people driving it, with young businesses driving it. And our per capita income will go from eighteen hundred - two thousand dollars per capita, to five thousand dollars per capita. Our mid-income or the middle class in India which is about 50% of its total number of households, will grow to three to four percent per year. And I think that Facebook, Jio, and a lot of other companies and entrepreneurs in the world, have a golden opportunity to be in India, to be part of this economic and social transformation, that we are witnessing and that will accelerate in the coming decades.  Mark Zuckerberg: I completely agree, and your company has already done so much to help fuel this. Reliance brought about the 4G revolution in India, and I know that 5G now is another big focus for you. But what your company has done here I think, has been truly remarkable in helping to bring hundreds of millions of people onto the internet and bringing opportunity. And I&rsquo;m curious, as you look ahead to the future in India, what other technologies or developments are you excited about now? And where do you see the country in the next five to ten years?  Mukesh Ambani: Well, as I mentioned to you Mark, I really see India accelerating as a premier digital society. I see us integrating both 5G&hellip;and just yesterday, our Prime Minister has said that, he wants every village and every gram panchayat&hellip;India has 680,000 villages, and we have a population of 1.3 billion people, and he wants everybody to be empowered on the information highway with high speed fix broadband, and which is happening. We also think that compute and very low latency compute is real. I think that there is a great opportunity for really bringing education and health care. With the second-generation reforms that were done in the last six months, we have unique opportunities and as Jio we are connecting all the 1.9 million schools in India and the 58 000 colleges. At any point in time, we will have in the coming decades, about 200 million children or young adults, between the age of 3 and 18 in our education system. I think that in a span of 10 years, we can set for ourselves an objective really to reskill India and the talent that you talked about, can improve 10x. Today, you're just seeing the creamy layer, but that's what technology can do to really make a better India and a better world. The same thing we can do in health and all the emerging technology and integrations, where we can make sure that we deliver services, and we deliver good proactive health. We've learned that and I think we're going to use technology. We are working very closely with all the authorities to make sure that we provide the technology tools and backbone for even vaccination in the coming quarters using technology. So, I think health, education&hellip;.we've already&hellip; and I think that what India has done is in a sense, we have democratized value creation with the drive of our Prime Minister. And you can see it in payments, you will see it in terms of making sure that technology is easily available and we made it affordable, so that millions of millions of people, even at this lower per capita basis can use this in a large market. And with that finally, I really see the enterprise and the enthusiasm of young Indians, their aspirations, and their confidence that is really driving India. And that is why I think that the next two decades are going to be historic in terms of the social and economic transformation.  Mark Zuckerberg: That makes sense. You, of course, already talked about commerce and driving small businesses and entrepreneurship. It always blows me away that India has more than 60 million small businesses, and millions of people around the country rely on them for jobs and that's a big part of what I hope that our partnership can serve here. We support more than 50 million WhatsApp business app users globally every month already. And more than 15 million of these are in India. So you know with communities around the world now in lockdown there are a lot of these entrepreneurs who need digital tools that they can rely on to find and communicate with customers and grow their businesses. And now this is just something that I think that our partnership can really help with. And of course, beyond the impact on small businesses.I just think that this year has reminded us of how essential technology can be as a tool for people, to just connect with each other. Whether it's using the networks that your companies have established, or the tools that we've built to be able to have that human connection, and find important information. And as you said, I can't imagine going through the pandemic 10 years ago, two decades, when the internet was still nascent. It should have been a completely different experience. And technology, of course, is allowing us to make sure we can get accurate information out to people that has implications in health, like you're talking about, in education and helping serve people better. And I think it shows a lot of the promise for what's ahead and I think we've certainly fared better now, than we would have if the pandemic had hit us before.  Mukesh Ambani: I couldn't agree more, Mark.  Mark Zuckerberg: You know, going back to Reliance, one of the great business stories in history, your father founded Reliance Industries and he has this incredible legacy here in India. And now I&rsquo;ve read that, he once held up a postcard in his office and said, if every Indian could speak with each other at the cost of this postcard, where will India be? And now your father clearly had a vision for where things were heading in the country, and because today Indians can communicate with one another for less than the cost of a postcard, and that's what we've tried to do with messaging&hellip;and hopefully we can do that together with payments and make it so people can use India's new UPI system, which I think is just great. It's a tremendous public good that the government has put out there. But I am curious, before we get into UPI and more on that, what's the most important thing that you learned from your father and his legacy, that has helped you build these amazing businesses and get to where they are today?  Mukesh Ambani: So Mark, thank you for those kind words on my father. Just so that when he motivated us in 2000, in terms of saying, can you make voice at the cost of a postcard? In 2020, we're very proud that Jio has pioneered free voice. So, all the 400 million people are a tribute to his vision. They are on our network and have a free voice. And as you said, my father was a son of a school teacher. He came to Mumbai with just a thousand rupees in 1960 and established Reliance with a belief that I will invest in businesses of the future, and I will invest in talent. And, for all the young people at Reliance and across India, I repeat my learnings in terms of building Reliance, three basic tenets really. One is, for entrepreneurs, it's important to have courage and self-belief. There can be no better person to demonstrate that in the last couple of decades than you, Mark. So you know, all of us believe that we have to believe in ourselves. And all of us know as entrepreneurs that we don't succeed at the first attempt, and self-belief comes to you when you fail. And self-belief increases your confidence when you succeed. So, courage and self-belief is something that I always tell entrepreneurs, remember that it's important. The second piece that he started and he's instilled into all of us is that, while you succeed, it's important to always have empathy and creativity in everything that you do. And by empathy, I mean, put yourself in the other's shoe, and make sure that how you make them feel is how you would want to feel. At Reliance, we do that at many levels now - we care for our employees, our investors, society, environment, and above all national interests of India. You know, within creativity&hellip;.and I always give this example in terms of saying that, when Reliance needed to grow, capital markets were not there. It was the 1980s, and my father came up by saying, I will actually share shares of Reliance, which was never done in the private sector. In the 80s, the first AGM of Reliance was in a football ground, and we had 60,000 shareholders. You and I both do annual general meetings. And his AGM in the 1980s for Reliance was in a football ground and he said, my purpose is really to win investor&rsquo;s confidence. Since then, creativity and empathy are critical as you go along. And the final thing that I have learned from my father, is really the importance of relationship, trust, and loyalty. The whole of Reliance right now, with hundreds of thousands of people, is one big family. We're not related by birth, but we are really woven together by passion, purpose, and conviction. We have faith in one another. We are loyal to one another, to this large Reliance family. For us, it's always one for all, and all for one. And I hope that a lot of people around the world can relate to this. That's what we believe at Reliance and for all of us at Reliance, he will still be the founder, if we follow his vision in terms of investing in businesses of the future. Mark, now that brings me to questions for you. Mark, what made you believe in India and the Jio story? As I said, you started this FDI avalanche in India, and the world recognized when Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, in the middle of lockdown said, I am going to bet on India and I&rsquo;m going to make even in this uncertain times, one of the largest foreign direct investments in India. What do you think of the digital network that you are clearly&hellip;.I call you the architect of the digital network of the world. While I have built some connectivity and broadband connectivity in India, you've done that for the world. Please share with us your experience as the digital architect of the world, how your global Facebook has helped people in this crisis, and your perspective of the crisis, and where you see the world today, and where it is going after you just explain to us what you&rsquo;ve done in India?  Mark Zuckerberg: Your words are incredibly generous. And we started this to help give people a tool to stay connected with their friends, and then expand to friends and family and communities, and a lot of this just ends up being a universal human phenomenon. No matter what country you're in, you know everyone cares about their friends and family, and their communities, and wants to stay connected. And what we've seen is that, India is actually home to the largest communities in the world, across Facebook and WhatsApp and getting there on Instagram, as well. So, we see the vitality and the entrepreneurship, and the creativity of businesses, and how much people want to connect, and you see a tremendous number of people coming online, a lot of that&hellip;thanks to your investments, and the work that you've done to enable hundreds of millions of people to come online here. And I just see a very promising future in India. We talked briefly about how there's a big trend of financial inclusion ahead, and how the ease of payments is going to be such a big deal for commerce, and giving people self-reliance and control of their own destiny, and a lot of that. We just launched WhatsApp payments in India last month - now you can send money to your friends and family through WhatsApp, as easily as sending a message. That was possible because of the UPI system that has been built in India. Unified Payments Interface, makes it easy for anyone to instantly accept payments across different apps. I think we're working with 140 banks or it's supported by 140 banks. India is the first country in the world to do anything like this. So, we're grateful to be able to support this kind of innovation and to help to work, to create more prosperity, and help achieve a more Digital India. And frankly, I think that a lot of other places around the world are going to be better off when they follow some of this lead that India has set, in creating public goods like this. So there's really a tremendous amount to be inspired by, with what is going on in India now. And we're just grateful to be able to serve our community here, and help people stay connected with the people they care about but also, create economic opportunity as well.  Mukesh Ambani: Thanks Mark, as you said, we are looking forward to your involvement and innovation in India, creating benefit for hundreds of millions of people and then taking this innovation to the rest of the world. I hope that the rest of the world learns from Indian policy, and what Facebook is able to achieve in India. And we as Indians will be very proud, if Facebook says we did it first in India, and then took it to 100 countries. And I look forward to working with you on that. Mark, all of us would love to know your views on how the world is changing, and what you and Facebook are thinking about it, and what you see the future as. Just give us your perspective, Mark.  Mark Zuckerberg: I think that there are a number of very important trends, but maybe I'll just talk about two. So, one is that, I think technology is giving individuals&rsquo; power and opportunities that were previously only held by large organizations. So, we've spent a lot of time today talking about small businesses, but one of the things that I think is so powerful about the internet is it makes it so that individual entrepreneurs and small businesses can now have access to the same kind of tools for reaching new customers and doing sophisticated analytics and communication that previously only bigger companies would have been able to build up the capacity to do that. And individuals can now share their ideas online, and get access to information in ways that previously only wealthier people or larger organizations would have had the capacity to share their ideas, or get access to information at that kind of scale. And overall, I think that just makes people's lives better. It's incredibly empowering and it's incredibly democratizing. India being the world's largest democracy, I think it really makes sense to lead there, because just empowering individuals, which I know is something that you believe deeply in as well, is just going to be a huge part of what will hopefully create a lot of prosperity, as you mentioned in the decades ahead. The other thing that I&rsquo;m excited about is more of a technological vision for the future. There are a lot of interesting technologies, but one trend that I focus a lot on is that as people we're always looking to connect with other people and share our experiences in the richest way that we can. So, if you look back to the beginning of the internet, most of the internet was text. We would text each other, chat, share our experiences but then connections got better. And then we got to photos being the primary way that we shared. And you know the old saying, a picture is worth a thousand words. Now, a lot of sharing is through photos and we're now on the next step with 4G and coming 5G networks - video is really becoming the primary way that people share. Anyone can largely capture something on their phones and can share it or stream it, and increasingly, people are able to consume that. And video is just a lot richer of a medium than photos even can be. When my daughters took her first steps, I wanted to capture a video of that and share it, not just a photo. But I don't think video is the end of the line. So, a lot of what I am focused on is helping to create virtual reality and augmented reality. So that way we can share not only a video of an experience, but you can use virtual reality to go into an experience and feel like you're right there. You can have holograms of digital objects that can kind of be as realistic as the physical objects that are there. Maybe you know, in five or ten years, when we're having this conversation, just a hologram version of me will be sitting on the couch next to you, instead of having to do this over a screen. And it'll feel a lot more realistic. So, I just think that's going to be incredibly powerful. And the power of virtual and augmented reality is they deliver the sense of a presence. You feel like you're right there with another person, which really will be the ultimate in human connection, and it will give people the opportunity to work and to connect, no matter where they want to be. So that's something that we're very focused on and invested in. And I&rsquo;m just very excited for the future. And on that note, let me just wrap up and just say again how grateful I am for everything that you and your companies do, and for the partnership. I do think that in so many ways, not just Jio and the technology platforms, but the other businesses that you've built, you've had such a positive impact on improving the quality of lives for hundreds of millions of Indians. A big part of why I was excited to partner with you is, there are not many people around the world who've just gone industry after industry and revolutionized them and improved them, and continue to do it, and have that hunger to improve the lives of so many people. So, I just have a deep admiration for that. And I am really looking forward to working together over the coming years and decades to make sure we can serve the people in India as well as possible. And hopefully, a lot of those advances will be expanded outside of India as well, to help people around the world. But I am incredibly grateful for your partnership on this. Thank you for joining me for this inaugural Facebook Fuel event today.  Mukesh Ambani: Thank you very much, Mark. And thank you for sharing your awesome vision of the future. You started this with saying that on Facebook, you would see the India - Australia cricket match, I look forward to a day when Facebook will take me with everything that you explained on virtual reality, where I will be sitting in Mumbai and be in a stadium in Australia. And I&rsquo;m sure that day, with your digital architecture and leadership, is not far away. Thank you so very much for having me.

","The Supreme Court on&nbsp;December 18 stayed criminal proceedings against former chairman of Wipro, Azim Premji, and his wife on their plea seeking quashing of the summons issued by a Bengaluru trial court on a frivolous and mischievous complaint filed by an NGO alleging breach of trust and corruption in merger of three firms with a Premji group firm. A bench of Justices Sanjya Kishan Kaul, Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy also issued notice to an NGO, Indian Awake for Transparency and others and sought their response.  Senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi, A M Singhvi appearing for Premji and others said that the complaint was mischievous in nature. Senior advocate S Ganesh and advocate Vipin Nair appearing for G Venkateshwara Rao, said that the NGO India Awake for Transparency is being used by one R.Subramanian, as a corporate fade to file frivolous litigation.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Premji and others have challenged the High Court order of May 15 which had rejected their pleas for quashing of the January 27, summons issued by the trial court. Others who had challenged the High Court order include Pagalthivarthi Srinivasan, then regional director in the ministry of corporate affairs M R Bhat and chartered accountant G Venkateshwara Rao.  The summons were issued by the trial court on the basis of a complaint filed by India Awake for Transparency alleging illegality in the transfer of assets worth Rs 45,000 crore from three companies into a private trust and a newly formed company. In their appeals, Premji and others have said that the complainant NGO had suppressed material facts and documents including that the scheme of amalgamation had already been sanctioned by Karnataka High Court by order dated March 26, 2015.  They said that the trial court order of January 27, taking cognizance and summoning the accused has been passed without judicial application of mind and without considering the fact that the scheme of amalgamation had already been approved by the High Court.  Rao in his appeal has said that the record clearly shows that complainant is linked to one R Subramanian-former promoter and director of a company known as Subhiksha Trading Services Ltd., which is a defaulter of Azim Premji's companies and complaint under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is pending against it.  Therefore there is clear animosity and bad blood between R Subramanian and Mr Azim Premji and the subject complaint appears to be one in line of many frivolous complaints and litigations instituted by R Subramanian against Azim Premji and his companies, many of which stand dismissed with cost by different courts/tribunals, the appeal of Rao said.  The complainant India Awake for Transparency (IAT) had alleged that Azim Premji, Yaseem Azim Premji and Pagalthivarthi Srinivasan were entrusted with the dominion over the properties and assets of three companies Vidya Investment and Trading Company Private Limited, Regal Investment and Trading Company Private Limited and Napean Investment and Trading Company Private Limited as directors.","Azim Premji, Business, Current Affairs, India, Supreme Court, Wipro","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/sc-stays-criminal-proceedings-against-former-wipro-chairman-azim-premjiothers_14592881.html

Nayar said the spending seen during the festive season was driven by pent-up demand, and consumption is yet to fully stabilise in various sectors.

It projects a small contraction for October-December at 1 per cent, and a positive growth of 1.3 per cent in January-March.  &ldquo;Subsequently, improving economic fundamentals, a bright outlook for the rabi season, and the visibility of vaccine availability are expected to strengthen demand,&rdquo; said Aditi Nayar, Principal Economist with ICRA Ltd.  &ldquo;The recovery under way in the Indian economy in Q3FY21 is fragile, and appears prone to risks related to rising costs, as well as a re-appearance of supply-side disruptions in some states,&rdquo; Nayar, however, warned.  Nayar said the spending seen during the festive season was driven by pent-up demand, and consumption is yet to fully stabilise in various sectors. While many indicators have displayed growth in the ongoing quarter relative to a weak performance in the same period in FY20, volumes still remain below FY19 levels in a number of sectors, highlighting that a full recovery remains somewhat distant, she said.

That was 2019. But things could change next year as Maruti is reportedly working on a diesel engine for launch in 2021. More on this later in today&rsquo;s wrap of the week, here&rsquo;s a look at all the news that made headlines.  Toyota labour issue declared illegal  The Karnataka Labour Commissioner held a meeting today with workers of Toyota Kirloskar a week after Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa stepped in to end the stalemate.  In an interview with&nbsp;Moneycontrol,&nbsp;Akram Pasha, the Labour Commissioner, said: &ldquo;We met with the workers of Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) today. We have declared that the strike and the lockout are illegal.&rdquo;  Fiat to set up $150mn centre in Hyderabad  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), on December 16, announced a $150 million investment to set up a new global digital hub in Hyderabad.  This new innovation and technology development facility is the FCA&rsquo;s largest digital hub outside of North America and EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa). The facility will create 1000 new jobs by the end of 2021.  Car companies to hike prices  Buoyed by a sustained pull in demand for the fourth consecutive month, automotive companies will institute a price hike in January to offset input cost pressures and improve their sagging profit margins.  The hike, which comes into effect from January 1, will affect buyers of two-wheelers, cars, SUVs and commercial vehicles. Commodities such as metals, polymers, plastic and precious metals have seen prices increase, claim automakers.  Tata Motors to buyout partner stake in bus venture  Tata Motors&nbsp;will buy the 49 percent stake held by its partner Marcopolo in the bus-making joint venture for Rs 100 crore bringing curtains to the 14-year old partnership and paving the way for a smooth exit for the Brazilian company.  Post the purchase, Tata Marcopolo Motors (TMML) will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Motors. All technologies pertaining to existing bus body products manufactured will continue to vest with TMML.  Ssangyong misses loan repayment  Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra&nbsp;on Tuesday said its loss-making Korean arm SsangYong Motor Company has missed repayments of loans aggregating to 60 billion KRW (around Rs 408 crore).  In a regulatory filing, Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra (M&amp;amp;amp;M) said the South-Korea listed SsangYong Motor Company (SYMC) has outstanding loans aggregating to 100 billion Korean Won (approximately Rs 680 crores).  Hyundai i20 gets 30,000 bookings  Hyundai Motor India on Monday said it has received around 30,000 bookings for all new version of its premium hatchback i20 in last 40 days.  The company, which is the second largest passenger vehicle maker in the country, said it has already delivered 10,000 units of the model so far.  &nbsp;Ola to invest Rs 2,400 crore in TN  Ride-hailing platform Ola on Monday said it has inked an agreement with the Tamil Nadu government to invest Rs 2,400 crore for setting up its first electric scooter factory in the state.  Upon completion, the factory will create nearly 10,000 jobs and will be the world's largest scooter manufacturing facility that will initially have an annual capacity of 2 million units, a statement said.  Maruti on diesel  The start of this financial year also brought farewell to diesel engines from Maruti Suzuki as the Delhi-based company declared that it will focus only on petrol engines. Chairman R C Bhargava had claimed the cost to upgrade diesel engines to Bharat Stage VI (BS-VI) emission norms would be prohibitively high thus making them unviable to consumers.  So presently Maruti Suzuki, which is India&rsquo;s largest carmaker, does not have even one offering of diesel car in its portfolio. But as many as seven models &ndash; Swift, Ciaz, Dzire, Ignis, Baleno, Brezza, S-Cross &ndash; came with diesel engines. Diesel engine cars commanded 25 percent of Maruti&rsquo;s portfolio sales in early 2019.  Also, at that time Bhargava had added that if need arises then Maruti Suzuki could develop a 1.5 litre diesel engine provided there is enough demand for diesel engines. The Delhi-based company has manufactured and sold the 1.3 litre Fiat-derived four-cylinder engine, which also became its most famous diesel engine. The company had developed a tiny 0.8 litre diesel engine for the Celerio but discontinued it sooner than expected.  Now according to a PTI story earlier this week Maruti Suzuki is planning a return to the diesel segment as early as next year though there is no official confirmation from the company on it. Maruti&rsquo;s no presence in diesel has hurt its volumes.  For instance, the Vitara Brezza, which was sold only with a diesel engine until FY20, is now powered by a petrol engine only. Its rivals like Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Mahindra XUV300, Ford EcoSport and Tata Nexon are offered with diesel options.  The result is that the Brezza has slipped to the third position in the compact SUV space from the first-place last year. Sonet and Venue have grabbed the first and second place, respectively.  Diesel&rsquo;s share in the industry&rsquo;s passenger vehicle segment is at 17 percent, according to Maruti Suzuki India. And most of that share is in the SUV segment as hatchbacks and sedans have just 1.5 percent in diesel.  As with Maruti&rsquo;s rivals a few companies have also said no to diesel as well. Renault, Nissan, Toyota and Volkswagen have given up diesel engine also.  Hyundai, the country&rsquo;s second largest carmaker has said that it will produce diesel engines as long as there is demand for it and demand for Hyundai&rsquo;s diesel engines continue to be strong. The Creta, for instance, has a diesel share of 55 percent.","Auto, Business, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/this-weekauto-a-Ã¢ÂÂuÃ¢ÂÂ-turn-by-maruti-suzukidiesel_14593881.html

The NIIF also announced that it is targeting to raise $2.1 billion for a private equity fund.  The master fund invests in operating assets in core infrastructure sectors, primarily transportation and energy, according to a statement.  Public Sector Pension Investment Board or PSP Investments, one of Canada's largest pension investment managers and DFC, a development finance institution of the US federal government, are new investors in the master fund, while Axis Bank was already invested.  Other investors in the master fund include Government of India (GoI), Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), AustralianSuper, CPP Investments, Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, Temasek, HDFC Group, ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance.

The SYMC has filed an application for commencement of rehabilitation procedure with the Seoul Bankruptcy Court under the Debtor Rehabilitation and Bankruptcy Act of South Korea, M&amp;amp;amp;M said in a regulatory filing.  The troubled automaker has also applied for an autonomous restructuring support (ARS) programme which is a court designed process, it added.  &amp;quot;If the Court approves the ARS, SYMC will continue to function under the supervision of its board and will negotiate with stakeholders to reach an understanding about a revival package which may include equity and debt financing and other related actions,&amp;quot; M&amp;amp;amp;M said.  However, some of its decisions will be subject to Court approval, it noted.  The Seoul Bankruptcy Court will deliberate and review the application and relevant documents submitted by SYMC to determine whether or not the court will commence the restructuring process of SYMC, M&amp;amp;amp;M said.  Last week, M&amp;amp;amp;M had informed the bourses that SYMC has missed repayments of loans aggregating to 60 billion KRW (around Rs 408 crore).  The Korean automaker has outstanding loans aggregating to 100 billion Korean Won (around Rs 680 crore).  In April this year, M&amp;amp;amp;M board rejected a proposal to inject any fresh equity into SYMC.  The Mumbai-based auto major had acquired the loss-making SsangYong in 2010 but failed to turn it around since then despite several attempts.

789,2020-12-22 07:25:15+05:30,Hero MotoCorp Ltd.,HEROMOTOCO,Hot Stocks | Here are three trading ideas for next 2-3 weeks,Banking and finance carry more than 40 percent weight in the Nifty and that is why we should not expect bigger performance divergence between them.,"Nifty nosedived more than 3 percent with heavy volumes on December 21. Bank Nifty underperformed by plunging more than 4 percent.  For Nifty and Bank Nifty - both&nbsp;- this was the highest single-day fall since May 18, 2020.  Nifty breached the crucial supports of 8-day EMA, 13-day EMA and 20-day SMA. Bank Nifty violated the crucial support derived from the upward sloping trendline on the daily chart.  Last week, Bank Nifty ended up forming a Doji candlestick on the weekly chart, which created the chances of trend reversal after a prolonged uptrend.  The fall registered on December 21 in Bank Nifty has confirmed the short-term bearish reversal. There has also been the development of negative divergence by RSI oscillator on the Bank Nifty daily charts, which has now got the price confirmation, too.  Bull market corrections usually happen sharp and swift; it also consumes less time.  This correction seems more like a typical bull market correction, which could continue to be there for a while.  Nifty is expected to decline further towards 12,750-12,800 support, derived from an upward sloping trendline, adjoining major troughs on the daily charts.  We expect more panic in Bank Nifty, where we can expect a decline towards 27,750 and 26,800-odd levels.  Intraday bounces should be utilised to initiate fresh shorts in Bank Nifty. Unless Bank Nifty closes above 30,400, the short-term trend would be considered bearish.  Resistance for the Nifty is seen at 13,600-odd levels.  Sectors like FMCG, pharma and IT can outperform in this scenario. On the other hand, we expect finance, cement, auto and metals to underperform from here on in the short term.  Banking and finance carry more than 40 percent weight in the Nifty and that is why we should not expect bigger performance divergence between them.  Markets have entered the short-term downtrend. We cannot rule out the possibility of a further sell-off from the current levels.  One should remain bearish in Nifty unless we see a close above 13,600 in Nifty and 30,400 in Bank Nifty.  Here are three sell calls for the next 2-3 weeks:  Hero MotoCorp December Future | LTP: Rs 2,980 | Target price: Rs 2,800 | Stop loss: Rs 3,100  This stock has breached crucial upward sloping trendline support on the daily charts. Short-term moving averages have come down below medium-term moving averages.  Indicators and oscillators have turned bearish on the hourly and daily charts. The auto sector has been underperforming for the last couple of weeks.  Axis Bank December Future | LTP: Rs 578 | Target price: Rs 530 | Stop loss: Rs 600  Bank Nifty has witnessed a breakdown on the short-term charts. Axis Bank has developed moving average bearish crossovers.  The stock closed at the lowest level since November 9, 2020 and has breached the last six week&rsquo;s low.  The stock price has formed a lower top and lower bottom formation on the daily chart.  Ramco Cement December Future | LTP: Rs 791 | Target price: Rs 745 | Stop loss: Rs 827  The cement sector started getting distributed much before the Nifty and the sector has been underperforming for a while.

791,2020-12-22 13:21:49+05:30,Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd.,APOLLOHOSP,How Covid-19 brought the faultlines of India&rsquo;s creaking healthcare to the fore,"For many Indians who get hospitalised, the road to recovery passes through the desolate swampland of poverty and debt. Out-of-pocket health expenses drove 55 million Indians into poverty in 2017 alone. In Part 1 of a deep dive into the healthcare system, Viswanath Pilla traces the journey undertaken by Odisha&rsquo;s Ganesh Prasad and Telangana&rsquo;s Lakshmi Narasamma. In fine detail, he outlines what the disease did to the duo, how the healthcare system saved one, lost another and plunged both families into penury ","Ganesh Prasad, 52, earns a living through his small kirana store in Bakutagam village, on the border of the Ganjam and Khorda districts in Odisha. Life in Bakutagam remained normal until June: Prasad&rsquo;s shop was open and he was able to run his business. Things began to change, however, as migrant workers from the village began to return. The Central government had been running Shramik special trains to ferry these migrant workers, who were out of work and stuck in big cities.  This region of Odisha, despite its paddy cultivation, handlooms, beaches and the famous Chilika lake, remains backward. Thousands of people migrate to faraway States such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka in search of work.  When they returned, the migrant workers also brought with them the dreaded coronavirus. The two districts of Khorda and Ganjam alone contributed about 558 or close to one-third of the 1,829 deaths in Odisha.  Prasad &mdash; and people like him &mdash; is highly vulnerable to the infection given his age and the nature of his livelihood. The infection eventually reached the family &mdash; what followed was utter misery, as they found that getting healthcare wasn&rsquo;t just an emotionally draining experience, but one that pushed them into a poverty and debt trap as well.  The path to poverty  Despite State and Central health insurance schemes, and a vast network of government hospitals, out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure remains one of the biggest reasons for people falling into poverty.&nbsp;The Covid-19 pandemic made matters worse for thousands of families.  A 2018 study by the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) has estimated that out-of-pocket health expenses drove 55 million Indians into poverty in 2017.  As per the National Health Accounts (NHA) 2016-17, Out of Pocket Expenditure (OPE) as a percentage of total health expenditure is 58.7 percent. There was a small decline from the highs of 64.2 percent in 2013-14, but it still remains one of the highest.  With a few exceptions such as AIIMS&ndash;Delhi, government hospitals have been on the path of deterioration due to chronic underfunding, shortage of doctors and nurses, a lack of state-of-the-art medical equipment, hygiene and accountability, as well as corruption.  A system in decline  The Central government&rsquo;s spend on healthcare amounted to 1.6 percent of the country&rsquo;s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in FY20. The government said it plans to expand the public spend to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2024.  The supply-demand imbalance of doctors and hospital beds in India is quite stark. According to the latest World Bank Human Development Report (2020), India had 8.6 doctors for 10,000 people from 2010&ndash;2018, and five hospital beds per 10,000 people from 2010&ndash;2019. In terms of bed availability India ranks 155th among 167 countries.  Meanwhile, governments have slowly shifted gears from being providers to payers of care. In addition, the rise of health insurance has led to the expansion of private hospitals and diagnostic chains. The National Sample Survey Office&rsquo;s 71st round data shows that private hospitals, clinics and nursing homes provide over 70 percent of healthcare in India.  The trust in government hospitals has been eroded further by most politicians and bureaucrats getting treatment in private hospitals. But private care, especially corporate hospitals, is unaffordable for most Indians.  The pandemic has exposed the faultiness of the Indian healthcare system. So far, close to one crore Indians have tested positive for the Covid-19 infection and about 1.5 lakh have died. As per the National Health Accounts (NHA), Out of Pocket Expenditure (OPE) as a percentage of total health expenditure is 58.7 percent. There was a small decline from the highs of 64.2 percent in 2014, but it still remains one of the highest Moneycontrol spoke to some of the affected families, lawyers, hospital executives and health activists to find out what ails the system. It also saw copies of PILs, bills, and discharge summaries of the people.  Chasing impoverishment  One day, Prasad felt feverish and had chills. He took common fever pills for a couple of days but the fever persisted. He was taken to a nearby primary health centre, where he was diagnosed as having typhoid. Prasad was given medication but his condition deteriorated. He stopped eating and had difficulty in breathing. The family took him to Balugaon government hospital in Khordha district, which was closest to their village.  Prasad&rsquo;s oxygen level had dipped to an alarming level of 76 and he was having symptoms of pneumonia. The hospital asked them to immediately take him to Bhubaneswar, the largest city and the capital of Odisha, where much of the state&rsquo;s health infrastructure is based.  Prasad&rsquo;s elder son Babul Supriyo Sahoo, 25, hired an ambulance, and took his father to Capital Hospital in Bhubaneswar, nearly 100 km away. He was told there were no beds available. From Bhubaneswar he took his father to SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack, about 30 km away, but couldn&rsquo;t find a bed there either. He returned to Bhubaneswar, and his search for a bed took him to SUM Hospital, Care Hospital, Vivekananda Hospital, AMRI and Apollo Hospitals. Everywhere the stock answer was: &ldquo;No beds.&rdquo; Meanwhile the oxygen cylinders in the ambulance were exhausted, and time was running out for Prasad.  Prasad&rsquo;s son Babul said they decided to return to Berhampur, the headquarters of Ganjam district. They finally got a bed in the Covid ward at the government&rsquo;s MKCG Hospital. Prasad underwent a Covid-19 test but his report came back negative. The hospital authorities asked the family to shift Prasad to a non-Covid ward. The staff at the non-Covid ward refused to give him a bed. Despite testing negative, Prasad&rsquo;s condition didn&rsquo;t improve.  To get him better treatment, the family decided to shift Prasad to Visakhapatnam, the closest other big city with decent health infrastructure, but still 280 kilometres away in Andhra Pradesh State. But Visakhapatnam, too, had been battered by Covid-19, especially during September and October, and was facing an acute shortage of beds.  When they got to Visakhapatnam, Babul took Prasad to Seven Hills Hospital. Immediately an HRCT (high-resolution computed tomography) scan was carried out, and they were told Prasad&rsquo;s Covid was at CORADS-5 level. CORADS is an assessment system to measure the level of Covid-19 involvement in the lungs and CORADS-5 is the highest level of risk assessment for Covid-related pneumonia.  Seven Hills, however, told Babul that its ICU beds were full. Once again the chase for a bed began. The hospital would first ask for a deposit of Rs 1 lakh. Babul said he even sold his mobile to pay for the ambulance charges.  In Visakhapatnam, he shifted his father to three private hospitals, including Apollo Hospitals. Babul said that by the time he was admitted to Apollo, his father&rsquo;s condition had stabilised, but the family had run out of money. So, Prasad was shifted to the government&rsquo;s King George Hospital (KGH). At KGH, Prasad made a good recovery and was discharged.  Babul says the family has spent about Rs 7 lakh, of which it borrowed Rs 4 lakh. With interest he says it has now become Rs 5 lakh. The remaining money was arranged by relatives, friends and others.  Covid, laments Babul, has turned the clock back for the family.  Overcharging  State governments that are aware of the ground realities of unaffordability of Covid care in private hospitals have resorted to capping the charges for treatment and diagnostics. But there are still huge gaps in implementation, and enough loopholes for exploitation.    In July, K Lakshmi Narasamma, 65, from Chintal, a working class neighbourhood in Hyderabad surrounded by an industrial cluster, began suffering body pain and fatigue, which progressively worsened.  Her family rushed her to a nearby nursing home. At night her pulse dropped and she complained of breathlessness. The nursing home didn&rsquo;t have oxygen support, and asked the family to take her to a hospital that had such a facility.  Thus began the family&rsquo;s nightmarish ordeal. Narasamma&rsquo;s kin began calling hospitals to see if there was a bed available to admit her. After calling at least a dozen hospitals, and using whatever connections they had, one private hospital, 25 kilometres away, agreed to offer a bed.  But when they got Narasamma to the hospital, the authorities there said the patient needed ICU care and that they did not have any vacant ICU beds. The family once again had to make frantic calls. To their relief another private hospital, closer home, agreed to admit her, but with conditions.  The hospital asked the family to deposit Rs 5 lakh, and Rs 50,000 per day. Given the urgency of the situation, the family paid Rs 4 lakh, and admitted the patient. Soon her swab samples were taken, and an RT-PCR test confirmed it as Covid-19.  &ldquo;After four days of her admission, we got a call from the billing section. They told us the deposited money is exhausted and demanded we pay another Rs 1 lakh. We weren&rsquo;t given any provisional bill, so we really didn&rsquo;t have any idea for what they were charging,&rdquo; said Sai Balaji, nephew of Narasamma, who was dealing with the hospital.  On the tenth day, the family decided to shift the patient, as they had run out of money. Balaji said the years of savings pooled to buy a house were used-up in paying the hospital.  The hospital&rsquo;s total bill came to around Rs 6,70,000.  In its discharge summary, the hospital wrote that the patient was classified as CORADS-3, a mid-level risk assessment as per the HRCT scan. Narasamma was kept on Bipap or non-invasive ventilation.  &ldquo;Patient needs hospital stay, but attenders are not willing for further hospital stay. So patient being discharged,&rdquo; the summary sheet read.  The family shifted Narasamma to the government&rsquo;s Gandhi Hospital on August 8. She died later that day.  During this time her nephew Balaji came to know that the Telangana government had capped the rates of Covid-19 treatment in June. When he compared the Telangana government rates to the rates charged by the hospital, Balaji said he found discrepancies and the hospital flouting Telangana government price-cap norms.  The Telangana government capped ICU isolation with ventilator at Rs 9,000 per day, which included monitoring and investigations such as CBC, Urine routine, HIV spot, Anti HCV, HbsAg, Serum Creatinine, USG, 2D ECHO, drugs, consultation, bed charges, meals, procedures such as Ryle&rsquo;s tube insertion and urinary tract catheterisation. He found that the hospital was charging Rs 33,000 per day. It created several subheads for this purpose. For instance it is charging Rs 7,000 per day as ICU isolation care and charging separately for ventilators. After four days of her admission, we got a call from the billing section. They told us the deposited money is exhausted and demanded we pay another Rs 1 lakh. We weren&rsquo;t given any provisional bill, so we really didn&rsquo;t have any idea for what they were charging - Sai Balaji The biggest surprise for Balaji was the hospital charging Rs 12,000 per day on PPE kits. Balaji alleges that he was overcharged even on medicines and consumables.  Balaji took to microblogging site Twitter to draw attention to the hospital&rsquo;s actions. The Telangana government responded and deputed an official, Dr G Srinivasa Rao, to conduct an inquiry into the allegations. But Balaji says nothing happened thereafter. What makes matters complicated is that the hospital is owned by a politician from the TRS, the party ruling the State.  With not much happening from the government side, Balaji filed a writ petition in the Telangana High Court, making the Telangana government, Union Health Ministry and the hospital respondents.  Balaji told Moneycontrol that he has been getting calls from the hospital for talks but is determined to seek justice in the court.  &nbsp;Insurance is not enough  Talha Abdul Rahman, a Delhi-based advocate, has taken up the case of a Covid-19 patient. Rahman says that his client&rsquo;s father was hospitalised and passed away with Covid-19 complications at a large corporate hospital in Delhi.  &ldquo;My client&rsquo;s father was covered by medical insurance up to Rs 5 lakh. He was admitted to a large private hospital in Delhi. The hospital tried experimental drugs on him but he succumbed. In the end my client got a bill of Rs 9 lakh.  He was in for a shock as the insurance company paid less than Rs 2 lakh of the bill, asserting that it would only pay in accordance with the capped rates of the Delhi government. &ldquo;The rates the private hospital charged my client were rack rates, and not the Delhi government-capped charges. The hospital says that the price cap does not apply to patients who subscribe to insurance as a mode of payment,&rdquo; said Rahman.  &ldquo;I wrote to the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA) seeking clarity, but am yet to get any response from them,&rdquo; he added.  Rahman says there was confusion, as the Delhi government has asked private hospitals to reserve 40 percent of their beds for Covid-19 patients. Later it capped the Covid treatment charges for 60 percent of beds in hospitals.  So, if a private hospital has dedicated 100 percent of its beds to Covid-19 patients, it can charge rack rates for 40 percent of the beds. There is a substantial price difference and many patients did not understand this. Rahman alleges that private hospitals would say that 60 percent of their beds were full, but there was no way to verify this. It was found that people who could afford to pay and are politically connected were getting beds.  Symptoms of a larger malaise  Dr Alok Roy, Chair, FICCI health Services Committee, and Chairman of Kolkata-based Medica Superspecialty Hospital, disagrees with the argument that private healthcare is responsible for the impoverishment of people. He also refutes&nbsp;allegations of&nbsp;overcharging.  &ldquo;The rates for Covid care have been very restrained and well controlled from the private sector. The government has opened multiple Covid care centres and people can go there; they don&rsquo;t have to come to private hospitals. Today, every State government has its own hospitals, which are capable of treating patients,&rdquo; he said.  Roy added: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that Covid requires 2,000 medicines; four-five medicines are enough. The best part: 80-85 percent of people require nothing. So, only 5 percent require admission, and these are distributed among both government and private hospitals. Where is the pressure on people?&rdquo;  Roy added that there isn&rsquo;t any profiteering as claimed by numerous people.  &ldquo;Doctors are expensive. Nothing is manufactured in India, and we import everything (equipment). The cost of medicines, the government controls. Government charges 18 percent GST on everything I purchase. If the bill is 5 lakh, 1 lakh is the government&rsquo;s take. We operate on 10 percent EBITDA; PAT is 4 percent. Healthcare is not a profit game, it&rsquo;s a valuation game,&rdquo; Roy added.  The costs incurred by healthcare providers have jumped by at least 20 percent following Covid-19, he asserted.  Rajendra Patankar, CEO of Pune-based Jupiter Hospitals, says one cannot generalise about private healthcare using a few cases. &ldquo;It is always the patient&rsquo;s choice to take services from a private hospital,&rdquo; he pointed out.  &ldquo;Patients have the right to know the tentative estimate of the services they wish to avail before making the decision,&rdquo; he added. Patankar denies use of&nbsp;strong-arm tactics with patients.&nbsp;He says private hospitals&nbsp;actually &ldquo;end up losing many times, as patients don&rsquo;t pay or honour payments.&rdquo;  But health activists say that the above cited cases are not exceptions. &ldquo;Overcharging and flouting of rules is rampant across the hospital industry. The individual cases are mere glimpses of the much larger corruption and dishonesty in corporate healthcare. These stories are definitely a hallmark of the Covid era,&rdquo; says Malini Aisola,&nbsp; Co-Convenor, All India Drugs Action Network (AIDAN). The costs incurred by healthcare providers have jumped by at least 20 percent following Covid- Dr Alok Roy Aisola says that the argument that people have a choice between public and private healthcare isn&rsquo;t true. &ldquo;Over the period (since the Covid outbreak), many patients were pushed towards private healthcare due to a range of factors. For example, stoppage of non-Covid services in government&nbsp;hospitals that were converted to Covid designated hospitals or unavailability of beds,&rdquo; Malini says.  &amp;quot;For families with elderly or critical patients, there was often a mistrust in Government services. Public confidence suffers when politicians and bureaucrats make a beeline for prominent private hospitals&nbsp;for their treatment,&rdquo; she adds.  AIDAN, along with Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (JSA), has intervened on the civil society side in a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate Sachin Jain, which is seeking a directive regulating the cost of Covid treatment at private hospitals. NatHealth, AHPI and General Insurance Council have impleaded themselves in the case.  (This is the first in a series of reports on hospitals.

This recommendation comes just weeks after Harley-Davidson exited the India market, leaving its 33 dealership partners in the lurch. It was a part of suggestions made by the Standing Committee in its report titled &ldquo;Downturn in Automobile Sector-Its Impact and Measures for Revival&rdquo;.  The original recommendation came from the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA), whose members protested against the alleged unfair treatment meted out by Harley-Davidson over compensation and the subsequent adoption of just 10 dealerships by Hero MotoCorp. Hero MotoCorp has agreed to continue sell and service Harley's bikes in India under an agreement signed a few months ago.  Also Read: Harley Davidson dealers in India consider legal action over US company's exit  &ldquo;India does not have a franchisee law at present due to which the vehicle maker - Dealer agreements are highly skewed towards manufacturers. This leads to a tussle in managing dealership operations in various ways, very short term agreements and non-existence of a clearly defined exit policy,&rdquo; said a statement from FADA.  Countries like Mexico, Brazil, Spain, Albania, Russia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Japan, Australia, Italy, Sweden and Belgium now have such rules to protect the franchisee&rsquo;s which started with the USA introducing the same in the 1980s.  There are various examples where auto manufacturers suddenly announced their exit from India leaving auto dealers high and dry with their investments going down the drain. A few examples of such exits since 2017 are General Motors India, Man Trucks (a VW Group Company), UM Lohia and Harley Davidson India.  Also Read: Bicycles are suddenly selling like hot cakes - here is why  &ldquo;Currently, almost all auto dealerships are privately owned proprietorship or family owned businesses. Meanwhile, large automobile manufacturers are some of the biggest corporations in India and overseas. Because of the disparity in size and power between individual dealers and manufacturers, the government needs to accept the Standing Committee Recommendation and bring in Franchise Protection Act to level the playing field between Auto OEMs and Auto Dealers,&rdquo; FADA added. Franchise laws will actually level the playing field between large automakers and local dealers. - Federation of Automobile Dealers Association FADA India claims to represent over 15,000 automobile dealers having 26,500 dealerships including multiple Associations of Automobile Dealers at the regional, state and city levels representing the entire auto retail industry. Together the dealership fraternity employs around four million people at dealerships and service centres.  FADA also recommended foreign direct investment (FDI) in the auto dealerships segment which could lead to collaboration with dealership groups internationally without compromising on their ownership.","Auto, Business, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/psc-recommends-formationfranchise-protection-law-for-auto-dealers_14601901.html

Kotak Mahindra Bank has also been the top all-round wealth creator, the brokerage firm said.  The Annual Wealth Creation Study further revealed that Tasty Bite Eatables has been the fastest wealth creator In the last 5 years while Reliance Industries has been the biggest and Pidilite has been the most consistent in the same period.  Besides, Ajanta Pharma, Alembic Pharma, Astral Poly Tech, AU Small Finance and Bajaj Finance are among the 'potential 25 wealth creators for the next 25 years', said the brokerage firm.    The brokerage firm on December 22 announced the Motilal Oswal 25th Annual Wealth Creation Study, 2020.  For the last 25 years, the firm has been releasing a wealth creation study every year. Raamdeo Agrawal, Chairman of Motilal Oswal Group, commissions&nbsp;the study every year.  In this year's study, the brokerage firm attempted to shortlist 25 stocks likely to deliver handsome returns over the next 25 years.  As per the brokerage firm, it made a list of 150 mid-cap companies i.e. companies that are ranked 101 to 250 by current market cap.  It preferred consumer-facing, secular business models and eliminated cyclical businesses like auto ancillaries, capital goods, chemicals, oil &amp;amp;amp; gas and realty which reduced the list of companies from 150 to 114.  To ensure the chosen firms are very profitable, the brokerage firm said it&nbsp;picked companies with last 5-year average RoE greater than 15 percent. This reduced the list from 114 to 63.  Next, it judged the business potential and management potential of the companies, and selected only those which qualified on both counts. This reduced the list from 63 to 28.  After that, the brokerage firm flagged off market leaders from the 28 companies to arrive at a list of 13 companies. Apart from these 13 companies, the brokerage chose 5 such companies from the list of 28 that are beneficiaries of value migration. In situations of value migration, all companies benefit irrespective of market leadership.  Now, the total shortlisted stocks were 18.  The brokerage firm said it chose only large-caps for financials and picked 6 leader names for the portfolio, now taking the total to 24.  At last, it opted for a pure digital play, even if it didn&rsquo;t meet some of the above filters, taking the total to 25.  &amp;quot;We believe in the very long run, valuations matter less.

The proposed investment for this new facility, which will come up next to Bajaj&rsquo;s existing facility at Chakan near Pune, will be Rs 650 crore. The&nbsp;unit&nbsp;is expected to commence production in 2023.  The announcement by Bajaj Auto comes at a time when its rivals like Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India and Suzuki Motorcycle have adopted a &lsquo;go-slow&rsquo; approach as far as new investments are concerned. Market leader Hero MotoCorp, however, had announced a Rs 10,000 crore investment over 5-7 years towards new products and manufacturing facilities.  &ldquo;Under the arrangement, the Government of Maharashtra will facilitate Bajaj Auto in obtaining necessary permissions/ registrations/ approvals/ clearances/ fiscal incentives etc. from the concerned departments of the state, as per the existing policies/ rules and regulations,&rdquo; said Bajaj Auto in a statement.

From worldwide volumes of 280,099 units clocked in 2019, KTM is expecting to sell around 400,000 two-wheelers in 2022. This will include nearly doubling of production at Bajaj Auto&rsquo;s Chakan plant to 200,000 units, from around 108,000 units at present. This will include a mix of joint products (of KTM and Husqvarna bands) and KTM products distributed by Bajaj on a licence fee model.  The two companies have also started work on electric two-wheelers. The first of such e-bikes having power range between 3 and 10 kW (48 volts) will roll off the Chakan production line.

However, a technical bounce on December 22 once again took Nifty above 13,450 and the IT sector along with the pharma counter supported the up move.  On the derivatives front, both Call writers and Put writers were seen active during the session. Put writers were seen adding hefty open interest at 13,300 and 13,200 strikes while 13,600 and 13,700 Call strikes also witnessed immense open interest build-up in the weekly contracts.  On the technical front, secondary oscillators suggest that volatility is likely to grip the market in the coming sessions.  The defensive counters like IT and pharma could witness follow-up buying while banking and financial names are expected to remain choppy.  On the higher side, 13,700 would act as a strong hurdle for Nifty with bias likely to remain rangebound along with high volatility.  Here are three buy calls for the next 2-3 weeks:  HCL Technologies | LTP: Rs 917 | Target price: Rs 1,009 | Stop loss: Rs 835 | Upside: 10%  After testing Rs 910 level in October 2020, this stock has been consistently moving in a broader range of Rs 800 to Rs 900 for the last two months.  This week, the stock has given a fresh breakout after a prolonged consolidation and moved above the key resistance level of Rs 910 to test its 52-week high of Rs 919.25.  On the technical front, the stock has formed a rounding bottom pattern on the daily charts and given a fresh breakout.  Rising volumes with rising prices hint at the next upswing in the prices. Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 900-915.  Pidilite Industries | LTP: Rs 1,725.95 | Target price: Rs 1,905 | Stop loss: Rs 1,580 | Upside: 10%  The stock has been consistently moving higher and can be seen trading in a rising channel with the formation of higher highs and higher bottom.  On the weekly charts, the stock is holding well above its short and long-term moving averages.  At the current juncture, the stock is on the verge of a fresh breakout above the key resistance level of Rs 1,720.  Rising volumes with rising prices hint at a long build-up in the stock. Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 1,700-1,720.  Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro Infotech (LTI) | LTP: Rs 3,573 | Target price: Rs 4,000 | Stop loss: Rs 3,250 | Upside: 12%  This stock has been consistently moving higher and seen trading in a rising channel on the daily and weekly intervals.  At the current juncture, the stock has formed a Cup and Handle formation on the daily charts and given a fresh breakout above the pattern formation with marginally higher volumes.  Positive divergences on secondary oscillators also support the next up-move in the prices. Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 3,550-3,575.

Manageable asset quality outlook with a 97% collection efficiency, guidance of just Rs. 60,000 crore for FY2021 slippages and restructuring (~2.5% of gross advances), and only ~Rs 2,000 crore of provisions remaining provide comfort. Stock trades at 1.2x / 1.0x its FY2022E / FY2023E ABVPS which is reasonable; while we maintain cautious stance on PSU banks, we find that SBI is best-placed with strong fundamentals.

806,2020-12-24 11:27:18+05:30,Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd.,APOLLOHOSP,"From nursing homes to corporate hospitals, how private healthcare has managed Covid-19","Private medical practitioners and their nursing homes form the backbone of primary and secondary healthcare in rural and urban India. But unlike large hospital chains, which are more resilient in terms of finances, resources and clout, Covid-19 has put many private healthcare providers in a difficult situation. Viswanath Pilla brings out the chalk and charcoal difference in these two private-sector segments through the story of a tiny clinic in Tamil Nadu&rsquo;s Dindigul town","Note to Readers: This is second and final part of our two-part series on India&rsquo;s healthcare system. Part 1 took a deep dive into the system from the perspective of two Covid patients  &amp;amp;nbsp;  JC Sekar, 63, a general physician, has been running Sobha Clinic, a typical rural primary care nursing home, for over three decades in a Vadamadurai village, 17 km from the historic town of Dindigul in Tamil Nadu.  The nursing home is equipped with a lab and x-ray, and also provides inpatient services with 20 beds attached. The nursing home employs 20 people, of whom 16 are nursing assistants and the rest non-clinical staff.&nbsp; Sekar even maintains computerised records of his patients.  The nursing home is popular in that area and handles a heavy load of outpatients. Sekar says he works for more than 12 hours attending patients and often has to skip lunch.  The popularity of his clinic stems from quality care and the personal touch with patients that Sekar has become known for over the years. Another major reason is affordability; Sekar charges just Rs 50 per outpatient consultation.  Private primary care providers struggle&nbsp;  Private medical practitioners such as Sekar and their nursing homes form the backbone of primary and secondary healthcare in rural and urban India.  According to the National Health Policy&nbsp;(2017) report, only 1 in 5 Indians in rural India uses outpatient services at government health facilities due to the perception of substandard care, non-availability of essential services and drugs, and absenteeism.  But unlike their larger peers, who are more resilient in terms of finances, resources and clout, Covid-19 has put many&nbsp;private&nbsp;nursing homes in a difficult situation. Sekar says he had to shut down his clinic for 10 days beginning March 23, when the government announced the lockdown. The district collector&nbsp;later permitted nursing homes to open, on condition they take safety measures.  Sekar says he decided to open his clinic when many of his younger peers&nbsp;in the district were not ready to do so fearing infection.&nbsp; Primary care providers are known to be at much higher risk of getting infected by Covid-19 as they are the first ones to see patients.  Opening the clinic wasn&rsquo;t easy. Sekar had to put in place a series of measures to protect staff from getting infected. He ensured that the staff had sufficient protective gear such as PPEs, face masks and sanitisers all of which were scarce during the initial months of the pandemic. He shifted his outpatient consultation outdoors&nbsp; and even got a temporary pandal erected so that patients didn&rsquo;t have to suffer in the heat. The staff worked in two groups, spelling each other every two weeks. The nursing home also had to forgo inpatient services during that period.  Despite all these measures, there was a lingering fear and the staff had to be motivated.&nbsp;&ldquo;I have insured everyone, and assured them I will take care of them if they fall sick,&rdquo; Sekar explained.    Sekar was able to rally his staff but patients footfalls plummeted as they were not able to travel due to the lockdown. Telemedicine hadn&rsquo;t caught up in rural areas in a big way so they had no way to easily access healthcare.  All this came at a cost, of course, particularly the safety measures, even as&nbsp;OPD footfalls&nbsp;went down to a trickle and the IPD remained shut.&nbsp;&ldquo;Laying off people isn&rsquo;t an option, as families are dependent on these people,&rdquo; Sekar said.  For 3-4 months he paid the staff and for maintenance of the clinic from his savings.&nbsp;He was determined to keep the clinic running and available to anyone who needed care. &ldquo;Society gave me so much, I should give it back,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Old people were pooling and hiring private transport during those days to come to my clinic; this was motivating.&rdquo;  Since Diwali, Sekar nursing home has resumed inpatient services with 10 beds in action, and outpatient footfalls close to normal.  Sekar says the health of many patients has been deteriorating during Covid-19, especially people with chronic diseases. &ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t managed their high blood sugar and hypertension well, so we are seeing complications,&rdquo; he explained.  Large corporate hospitals more resilient  Sekar&rsquo;s nursing home isn&rsquo;t alone, as many nursing homes have struggled, and their businesses haven&rsquo;t fully recovered from Covid-19.&nbsp; The pandemic hasn&rsquo;t been easy for their larger peers either. The steep fall in OPD volumes and planned surgeries and Covid infection protocols meant staggering staff shifts. In addition, fixed overheads such as salaries, power, electricity, rentals and cost of capital have hit the industry in a big way. The price caps by the government were done keeping the public and patients' interest in mind, but there should have been some consideration based on costing studies of services - Rajendra Patankar But large corporate hospitals have been able to tide over the situation, as they were able to adapt much faster. Most returned to profitability or narrowed their losses substantially in the second quarter of FY21 (see graphic).  Large corporate hospitals were quick to embrace telemedicine. In addition, their scale, ability to cut costs and vertical diversification &mdash; a presence across segments such diagnostics, pharmacies and homecare &mdash; helped them quickly tide over the slump.  The Covid cases helped them offset the loss of revenue from non-Covid care. The easing of lockdowns by the second quarter of FY21 also brought in cases of non-Covid care, especially elective surgeries that had been deferred.  Back in the black  After reporting a loss of Rs 267 crore in Q1FY21, India&rsquo;s largest private healthcare provider,&nbsp;Apollo Hospitals,&nbsp;is back in the black, posting a profit of Rs 65.6 crore in Q2FY21. Revenue jumped 27.2 percent to Rs 2,772 crore, indicating a substantial recovery from Q1FY1, and inching towards the pre-Covid level of Rs 2,844 crore.&nbsp;There was a drop of 12.4 percent YoY in employee expenses.  Fortis Healthcare,&nbsp;too, has returned to profitability, reporting a profit after tax of Rs 15.5 crore in Q2FY21 versus a loss of Rs 187.9 crore in Q1FY21. Revenue rose Rs 994.7 crore in Q2FY21 from Rs 606 crore in the previous quarter of FY21.  Max Healthcare&nbsp;reported a profit of Rs 13 crore in Q2FY21 against a net loss of Rs 314 crore during the first quarter ended June 30, 2020. Revenues rose 150 percent to Rs 691.3 crore.  ICRA Ratings&rsquo; recent report says that large corporate hospitals have reduced costs to the extent of 15-20 percent, and the largest cost rationalisation has happened in doctor and employee expenses, the largest cost for hospitals.  &ldquo;The ARPOB (average revenue per occupied bed) and margins from the treatment of Covid-19 patients is much lower than that of electives and the margins from Covid-19 patients were further impacted due to the price caps placed by certain State governments; nonetheless, the contribution margin from treatment of Covid-19 patients has been positive and it has cushioned the pressure on profitability during these challenging times due to a sharp drop in electives and medical tourism,&rdquo; the ICRA report said. Since Diwali, Sekar nursing home has resumed inpatient services with 10 beds in action, and outpatient footfalls close to normal. The rating agency expects the occupancy of hospital companies to rise to 60 percent in FY22 from the projected occupancy level of 52 percent in FY21  Industry executives, however, lament that the price caps of governments are out of tune with the ground reality and economics. They say the caps are based on political considerations and while large corporate hospitals may weather the pandemic better, this isn&rsquo;t true for smaller standalone hospitals.  &ldquo;The price caps by the government were done keeping the public and patients' interest in mind, but there should have been some consideration based on costing studies of services,&rdquo; says Rajendra Patankar, CEO of Pune-based Jupiter Hospitals.  Another executive, who didn&rsquo;t want to be named, told Moneycontrol that an adverse regulatory environment has hastened the speed of consolidation in the hospital industry.&nbsp;In November, Manipal Hospitals acquired Columbia Asia Hospitals, making it the fourth-largest hospital network with 7,300 beds, 4,000 doctors and 10,000 employees.  That acquisition is in continuation of a large-scale consolidation taking place in India&rsquo;s hospital sector. Last year, Radiant Life Care, backed by PE firm KKR, bought Max Hospitals, making it the second-largest healthcare chain in India. IHH Healthcare&rsquo;s acquisition of Fortis is one of the largest deals in recent times.  A large hospital chain will unlock economies of scale, bring in operational efficiency and ensure effective utilisation of resources, something smaller hospitals are not in a position to do.  &ldquo;But lower competition&nbsp;isn't a good news for the&nbsp;common man,&rdquo; the executive cited earlier said.  &lsquo;Not a straightforward recovery&rsquo;  Malini Aisola, Co-Convenor, All India Drugs Action Network (AIDAN), a network of health NGOs and activists, says that the recovery of corporate hospitals has not always been straightforward.  &ldquo;Regular wards were converted to high-dependency units; there was expansion of ICUs and also cost cutting measures like reducing the salary of healthcare workers and consultants. It&rsquo;s also a story of piling costs on patients,&rdquo; Aisola said.  A high-dependency unit in a hospital is one where patients can be cared for more extensively than in a normal ward, but not to the point of intensive care.  &ldquo;The behaviour of the private hospitals is completely opportunistic. There has been overbilling. The trend has intensified during Covid. There have been arbitrary charges that have been added,&rdquo; Aisola asserted.","Business, Companies, coronavirus, Health","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/viswanath-pilla-6848/', 'name': 'Viswanath Pilla'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/from-nursing-homes-to-corporate-hospitals-how-private-healthcare-has-managed-covid-19_14608061.html

","After months of struggle that culminated in the failure to repay bank loans in time, South Korean SUV specialist SsangYong Motor Company filed for court receivership earlier this week.  Acquired in 2010, SsangYong has been the troubled unit for Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra (M&amp;amp;amp;M) almost every year despite several attempts by the Anand Mahindra-led company to turnaround operations.&nbsp;M&amp;amp;amp;M owns 75 percent equity of SsangYong.  The cash-strapped Korean company has posted losses for 15 consecutive quarters and has been struggling to stay afloat for several months now. It even sold non-core assets to generate liquidity earlier this year, after M&amp;amp;amp;M declined to inject new funds.  By the end of the March quarter, the Mumbai-based company wrote off investments of around Rs 2,000 crore it made in SsangYong after putting its entire stake in the Korean company for sale in February. Officially, it has not found any takers yet.  This is, however, not the first time that M&amp;amp;amp;M has had trouble in managing operations involving takeovers and joint ventures. A look at its brief history sheds light on its struggle to diversify to reduce dependence on its core business which is tractors and domestic SUV business.  Mahindra Navistar&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  M&amp;amp;amp;M&rsquo;s joint venture with Navistar of the US lasted for less than seven years after the two decided to part ways in 2012. M&amp;amp;amp;M bought out Navistar&rsquo;s stake in the two joint venture companies that made trucks, buses and engines. M&amp;amp;amp;M eventually absorbed the consistently loss-making companies into itself a year after it bought its partner&rsquo;s stake in 2013. In October this year, Navistar was bought by a Volkswagen subsidiary.  Mahindra Renault  Also in 2013, M&amp;amp;amp;M bought Renault&rsquo;s stake in the joint venture company that was responsible for making the Dacia Logan sedan for the Indian market. This loss-making JV lost steam in less than five years in 2010 after starting operations in 2005. Though M&amp;amp;amp;M tried to revive the business by rebranding the sedan to Verito and even pulling out a hatchback Verito Vibe, the business eventually folded up. Verito was later launched in an all-electric form.  Mahindra 2-wheelers  After entering the mass market two-wheeler space through the buyout of assets of Kinetic Motors, M&amp;amp;amp;M struggled for several ensuing years to crack the scooter and motorcycle market, which was heavily dominated by Hero MotoCorp, Honda, Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor. M&amp;amp;amp;M eventually decided to exit the mass market space and instead focus on the premium end under the Jawa brand for motorcycles and Peugeot brand for scooters.  Mahindra Tractors in China  The tractor division of M&amp;amp;amp;M enjoyed the longest stints in joint ventures in recent years within the group. Formed in 2008, the JV with Jiangsu Yueda Yancheng Tractor Manufacturing Co went on for nearly 10 years before the Indian company decided to sell its entire 51 percent stake in the JV in 2017. With the sale of its JV stake, M&amp;amp;amp;M also exited the country, which is one of the world&rsquo;s largest tractor markets.  Mahindra Pininfarina Engineering   Two weeks ago Mahindra Group company Tech Mahindra pulled the plug on Pininfarina Engineering after the pandemic made operations no longer relevant for the Italian company.

The Pune-based two- and three-wheeler maker earlier this week signed a pact with the Maharashtra government for setting up a new production facility for super premium-end motorcycles such as KTM, Husqvarna and Triumph along with electric vehicles (EV), starting with Chetak, at a proposed investment of Rs 650 crore.  &amp;quot;We believe that the premium segment of motorcycles will grow faster than others and Bajaj will be in a very good position to take advantage of this trend. And this is true for domestic and our overseas markets,&amp;quot; Bajaj Auto Ltd Executive Director Rakesh Sharma told PTI in an interaction on Thursday.  For Bajaj, the super premium-end motorcycles include Dominar, KTM, and bike models that would come from the company''s alliance with Triumph, he said.  &amp;quot;And of course, along with the expansion of the EV portfolio, all of these together, we think the sales of these should grow fast. So we are building that capability and preparing ourselves to exploit that opportunity,&amp;quot; Sharma said.  Bajaj Auto holds 48 per cent stake in Austrian premium sports motorcycle brand KTM. It introduced Husqvarna brand, which is part of the KTM group, in the country in February this year.  In January, the Pune-based automaker announced formal commencement of its non-equity global partnership with British iconic motorcycle maker Triumph to manufacture a range of mid-capacity bikes in the country.  According to Sharma, while Bajaj Auto''s overall motorcycle sales, including overseas, declined 21 per cent in April-November period of this fiscal, the premium-end motorcycle sales, which include sales of KTM and Dominar, grew 24 per cent during the same period.  &amp;quot;We can expect this double-digit growth to continue and this is the reason that we feel we need to invest in this new plant,&amp;quot; Sharma said.  The upcoming facility, the work for which is expected to commence very soon, will be located just four kilometres away from its existing manufacturing plant at Chakan.  It will be spread across 190 acres of land and the Rs 650-crore investment would mainly go into building, plant and machinery, among others.  The new plant, when fully operational, will have a total capacity of 1 million units per annum. The existing Chakan plant has a capacity of 1.20 million motorcycles per annum, he said.  The new plant will offer around 2,500 jobs directly and many more indirectly, with 50 dedicated vendors, he added.  In India, the overall motorcycle market is not in great shape currently, and sales in fiscal 2020-21 may end up at the level of fiscal 2013-14, Sharma said.  On Bajaj''s alliance with Triumph, he said the two partners were trying to make up for lost time as the R&amp;amp;amp;D work for the project got affected because of the pandemic.  &amp;quot;We can see there is some delay, but we will see how much we can cut that,&amp;quot; he said.  The first Bajaj-Triumph bikes will be available from 2022 with prices starting at less than Rs 2 lakh for a 200cc motorcycle, Triumph Motorcycles Chief Commercial Officer Paul Stroud had said while announcing the collaboration in January this year.","Auto, Business, Companies","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/bajaj-auto-expects-premium-motorcycle-sales-to-outpace-other-segments_14610301.html

This posed twin challenges for Indian IT firms -- how to ensure business continuity for customers and how to ensure safety of their own staff.","COVID-19 may have thrown curveballs this year but the USD 191 billion-Indian IT sector has shown resilience and 2021 promises more growth opportunities as digital spends go up to tackle the challenges amid the &amp;quot;new normal&amp;quot;.  Rapid rise in corona cases at the beginning of the year led to governments enforcing lockdowns in various countries, including India. This posed twin challenges for Indian IT firms -- how to ensure business continuity for customers and how to ensure safety of their own staff.  IT firms like Infosys, Wipro and Tech Mahindra booked chartered flights to bring home employees and their families, who were stranded overseas due to the pandemic and visa issues. And almost overnight, IT companies -- big and small -- embraced work from home.  There were initial hiccups but almost 98 per cent of the IT workforce was working from home at the peak of lockdown in India. Internal meetings, customer engagements and townhalls moved online.  &amp;quot;2020 has been a year of a lot of change and uncertainty... (but) technology is no more being seen as just an enabler, it has become much more integral.  &amp;quot;We were able to transition to a new hybrid operating model with very less downtime for our global customers that has enormously proven the capability of the Indian IT industry,&amp;quot; Nasscom Senior Vice-President and Chief Strategy Officer Sangeeta Gupta told PTI.  She added that customers appreciated the resilience of the industry and IT companies too continue to be agile and hungry for business.  There were concerns that the pandemic might have an impact similar to the one seen during the 2008 financial crisis. The global health calamity had sparked concerns that clients could cut down on their IT budgets to save costs.  As the new fiscal began, IT majors -- right from Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys to Cognizant -- presented a cautious outlook. They said that all campus offers would be honoured but salary hikes and promotions were put on hold. Infosys and Wipro suspended their practice of providing revenue growth outlook citing an uncertain business environment.  Unlike the 2008 financial crisis, where technology and the economic crisis were in intertwined and technology spending dipped amid economies slowing down, year 2020 saw technology adoption growing much faster than economy and businesses.  &amp;quot;The linkage between technology and economic downturns has got decoupled. This reiterates that technology is going to be integral for future growth. What this pandemic has done is made digital no more just as good to have, but a must have,&amp;quot; Gupta said.  Despite 2020 being a challenging year, companies like Infosys and Wipro closed multi-million and even billion-dollar deals. There were also deals like TCS acquiring 100 per cent shares of Postbank Systems AG (PBS) from Deutsche Bank AG for one euro., wherein about 1,500 PBS employees are transitioning to TCS.  This year has seen cloud adoption growing by leaps and bounds, and laggard sectors like healthcare and education are leading digital adoption today. With schools and colleges shut and hospitals having large number of coronavirus infected-people, these institutions have embraced technology to help students attend classes via smartphones, and patients get digital consultation for non-emergency ailments.  Industry experts said the pandemic has given digital transformation an acceleration that would have taken years to achieve. And IT companies are now making a bigger push for their digital offerings as technology gets ingrained across sales, customer service and operations.  However, there has also been a manifold rise in cyber attack cases, which highlights the need for enterprises to strengthen their IT systems as such threats could affect customer experience and brand image.  With the pandemic continuing and vaccines still in the works, Work From Home (WFH), which is the ''new normal'', is expected to become a key part of the corporate strategy. Whether 15 per cent or 50 per cent of staff is allowed to work remotely is still to be seen but hybrid work models will definitely be part of the post-vaccine world.  Recently, Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said the future workplace will be hybrid.  &amp;quot;Flexibility will remain critical, and even as we go forward, let''s say when we get past the COVID situation, the flexibility will allow our employees to work from different locations at different times... we also feel that the concept of social capital is extremely important... we have built different models. We have not defined exact contours,&amp;quot; he had said.  While the industry focussed on ensuring business continuity, the government also played a critical role in enabling this ease of working. It eased its policies around remote working for IT and IT-enabled services to reduce compliance burden on them and facilitated not just ''Work From Home'' but ''Work From Anywhere''.  The industry hailed this as a progressive move that will bring in more inclusivity as it would help bring people from smaller towns as well as women who have quit for various reasons, into the workforce.  The Indian government, which has been using technology to deliver citizen services, continued to bet on mobile and other technologies to provide people access to free ration, healthcare and other critical services amid the lockdown.  The year was also a critical one for the sector as the US -- the biggest market for Indian IT companies -- held Presidential elections. During the year, the Donald Trump administration had placed a number of restrictions on H-1B visas to restrict the ability of American companies to hire foreign employees.  Joe Biden has emerged victorious and is now scheduled to take over as the 46th US President on January 20. The industry will wait for the leader''s approach to the visa issue.  Gupta said one should look at India-US technology relationship beyond the H1-B visas, given that Indian IT companies are creating thousands of local jobs, skilling people and helping businesses stay competitive.  Skilling, in fact, has been a key area of focus for Indian technology companies as 5G and advent of smarter devices unleash a new era of growth and opportunities.  GlobalLogic Senior Vice President and Head of APAC Sumit Sood said as data becomes more ubiquitous, 5G and smart devices will transform and streamline customer experiences to a seamless, hyper-personalised engagement.  &amp;quot;... 2021 will bring more promise and propel businesses to include digitisation and invest in IT infrastructure as part of their core business strategy.  While our reality continues to evolve, businesses will realise great value in automation, cloudification, touchless and remote technology and Everything as a Service (XaaS) delivery models will shape the next phase of technology evolution to provide scalable solutions for mass adoption,&amp;quot; he added.","Business, Companies, India, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/resilient-it-sector-gearsfor-growth-opportunities-challenges-amid-39new-normal39_14619601.html
824,2020-12-29 13:28:14+05:30,Wipro Ltd.,WIPRO,Wipro open its share buyback offer: Should investor tender shares or hold?,Wipro will source the funds for its buyback from current balances of cash and cash equivalents and/or internal accruals. Borrowed funds will not be used for the buyback.,"Wipro, one of the largest IT software services companies, opened its share buyback offer on December 29.&nbsp;The company targets to raise Rs 9,500 crore via the buyback offer, which will close on January 11, 2021.  The floor price for its 23.75-crore equity shares offer (representing 4.16 percent of total paid-up equity) has been fixed at Rs 400, a 4.5 percent premium over Monday's closing price and 6.5 percent premium over October 13's closing price. The floor price premium stood at 11 percent compared to ex-date that has fixed for buyback. The board approved share buyback offer on October 13.  Experts advise short-term investors to tender their shares in the buyback offer.  &amp;quot;We believe that investors and especially retail investors having a short term view should tender their shares in the open offer given that the buyback is happening at a premium to current prices and acceptance ratio is likely to be better than that of TCS in the retail segment given lower retail holding in the stock,&amp;quot; Jyoti Roy, DVP - Equity Strategist at Angel Broking told Moneycontrol.  Prashanth Tapse, AVP Research at Mehta Equities expects Wipro buyback to have a better acceptance ratio (AR) in the range of 40-50 percent for retail investors.  &amp;quot;We have seen in several buy back offers, most small shareholders do not take part. As a result, the acceptance ratio becomes higher than the theoretical ratio. Hence as on date Wipro is providing a handsome returns through buyback offer, we suggest retail investors to tender and participate in the buyback offer,&amp;quot; he said.  The buyback is being undertaken by the company to return surplus funds to the equity shareholders, which are over and above its ordinary capital requirements and in excess of any current investment plans, in an expedient, effective and cost efficient manner.  Wipro will source the funds for its buyback from current balances of cash and cash equivalents and/or internal accruals. Borrowed funds will not be used for the buyback.  If the acceptance ratio turns out to be 100 percent, then shareholding of promoter and promoter group may increase to 74.45 percent from 74.01 percent, but if only the promoter and promoter group participate to the extent of the buyback entitlement, their shareholding may reduce from 74.01 percent to 73.30 percent.  Experts asked short term investors to utilise the funds received from buyback offer for buying peers in the same sector, but long term investors can continue holding the shares.  &amp;quot;The company has a weaker growth profile as compared to other largecap peers like Infosys and TCS. Investors can use the proceeds from the buyback and use it to diversify their holdings in the IT sector. At current levels we prefer HCL Technologies over Wipro in the largecap IT space given better growth outlook,&amp;quot; Jyoti Roy said.  There is no tax liability for the investor tendering their shares in the buyback.  &amp;quot;We would recommend investors with a long term investment horizon of greater than one year to hold on to the stock given strong demand growth expected for IT services due to increased adoption of digital technologies,&amp;quot; Jyoti Roy said.  Moreover, &amp;quot;the company has been revamping its business model under the new management which is expected to bear fruits over the next couple of years and help the company achieve industry average growth rates,&amp;quot; he added.  Prabhudas Lilladher feels the strong deal momentum will drive strong revenue growth in FY21 &amp;amp;amp; FY22.  &amp;quot;Large deal wins like Marelli, EON, John Lewis signed in 1HFY21 will ramp up and lead to revenue acceleration in 2HFY21. Aggression in deal wins has continued even in third quarter, which is seasonal weak quarter, with Wipro winning 5 deals Olympus, Thoughtspot, Fortum &amp;amp;amp; Verifone apart from the Metro deal in 3Q. This gives us confidence about superior execution of new Management at Wipro,&amp;quot; the brokerage explained.

It said robots ''Elle'' and ''Tee'' navigate Planet L&amp;amp;amp;T visitors, symbolising L&amp;amp;amp;T''s thrust on state-of-the-art tech experiences.  &amp;quot;L&amp;amp;amp;T, India''s leading engineering, procurement and construction projects, manufacturing, defence and services conglomerate, opened the doors to ''Planet L&amp;amp;amp;T,'' its sprawling new digitally-enabled corporate experience center,&amp;quot; the company said in a statement.  Located at its newly-built ''A M Naik Tower'' in Powai, Mumbai, the center is spread over close to 10,500 square feet.  Planet L&amp;amp;amp;T offers visitors an immersive experience of eight decades of the organization''s history and a glimpse into how technology is shaping its future.  &amp;quot;Planet L&amp;amp;amp;T is a testimony to the legacy the group has built over the past eight decades...

The company said the experience centre is divided into twelve key zones, enabling visitors to take the tour or focus on specific aspects of L&amp;amp;amp;T''s past, present, and future.  The focus on technology is demonstrated upfront in the entrance lobby where ''Elle'' and &lsquo;Tee&rsquo;, robotic hosts, greet and guide visitors to the first zone &ndash; the Welcome Dome, it said adding, a short film played on a mini-planetarium styled screen welcomes guests to Planet L&amp;amp;amp;T and showcases the ethos of the experience center.

831,2020-12-31 07:19:07+05:30,Eicher Motors Ltd.,EICHERMOT,"Hot Stocks | Can bet on Grasim Industries, Eicher Motors for short-term","Nifty is still holding well above the weekly pivot of 13,352, while also holding above the value zone of 13,666.","It was again a bull-favoured day for the benchmark index on December 30 where Nifty touched a new all-time high and managed to close in uncharted territory.  But the Doji candle formed on top is indicating the weakening of bulls' strength. So, till the time today's high does not get cut convincingly, the market may find the pressure at the current juncture.  Since a big candle down day of December 21, there has been a consistent rally in the market. The rally negated the bearishness of December 21.  Nifty is still holding well above the weekly pivot of 13,352, while also holding above the value zone of 13,666.  If we draw an upward rising trendline on the weekly chart connecting the low of 7,511 to its next connecting point of 10,790, one can find the next trendline support near 12,605 which is more than 1,250 points down from the current level.  Momentum oscillator RSI (14) continues to settle above its bullish range-shift zone and is currently reading well above 70 levels with positive crossover on the daily scale.  Meanwhile, the 21-day exponential moving average is placed near 13,529.  As Nifty is trading in uncharted territory, instead of finding tops and supply zone, one should continue adopting buy on every dips strategy.  Going forward, the trend in Nifty may remain bullish but the strength of bulls may be lesser compared to the previous few weeks.  At the higher end, the rally may extend towards 14,198. At the lower end, the support is placed at 13,660. The breach of 13,660 level will extend the fall to 13,530.  Here are two buy calls for the next 2-3 weeks:  Grasim Industries | LTP: Rs 937.10 | Target price: Rs 987 | Stop loss: Rs 899 | Upside: 5%  Grasim has completed its correction seen between December 9 to December 21.  Now it is approaching the recent high and the breach of that level will open the gates for new levels.  The momentum oscillator RSI is above the 60 mark. The Fisher-Transform indicator has also given a bullish crossover.  Grasim has got back above the upward sloping 20-day EMA which is a very bullish indication for the stock for the coming few sessions.  The stock is ready to touch weekly resistance 3 (R3) and resistance 4 (R4) if it sustains above the recent high of Rs 954.  On the downside, major support is near the psychological levels of Rs 900. One should keep the stop loss just a few ticks below Rs 899 on a closing basis.  Eicher Motors | LTP: Rs 2,521 | Target price: Rs 2,715 | Stop loss: Rs 2,410 | Upside: 8%  Eicher Motors has completed a rounding bottom and given the breakout from the formation.  The breakout zone at Rs 2,400 is successfully tested by it. Eicher is also outperforming the sectoral index Nifty Auto.  The momentum oscillator RSI (14) has started recovering post a hidden diversion near the recent bottom with a bullish crossover.  The Fisher-Transform indicator is also indicating the shift in momentum towards the bulls.  On the higher side, the first supply zone for Eicher is near the recent top of Rs 2,717 and support is just near the last three days' low of Rs 2,410.

834,2020-12-31 14:15:53+05:30,Cipla Ltd.,CIPLA,Will normalcy return to COVID-hit Indian pharmaceutical market in 2021?,"The pharmaceutical sector is expecting sales to normalise by the second half of 2021, with the availability of COVID-19 vaccine and coronavirus receding.","The domestic formulation business has been a highly competitive, yet stable growth driver&nbsp;for most Indian pharmaceutical companies. The year 2020 has shaken that belief.&nbsp;The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the Indian pharmaceuticals market (IPM) growth like never before. There are outliers even in this market like Cipla, Glenmark, Aristo and a few others, who were quick in responding to Covid-19 related medications, but most struggled.  To be sure, the year 2020 had begun on a good note with IPM clocking over 9 percent growth rate in the first three months of January to March. On March 24, the government announced nationwide lockdown, while the pharma industry operations were exempted, it still faced issues on the supply side, as workers were unable to come to factories; shortage of packaging, raw materials and disruption of logistics and distribution channels. On the demand side, restriction on medical representatives&rsquo; movement, the shutdown of hospital outpatient departments (OPDs), doctors stopped attending their clinics and deferment of elective and non-emergency surgeries impacted the generation of new prescriptions critical to growth.  April-June quarter saw the full impact of lockdown, with the IPM contracting 6 percent. The last time the Indian pharma market had been through such a situation was during the rollout of GST in Q2FY18 when distributors and retailers resorted to destocking of inventory. Even then, the market ended up growing 1 percent. While there is some recovery, thereafter especially in September-October of 2020, when the lockdowns were fully lifted.  The overall growth rate has dropped to 2.2 percent in 2020. Indian pharmaceutical market stood at Rs 1.44 lakh crore market as per moving annual turnover (MAT) November 2020. The drop in sales in acute-therapies such as anti-infective drugs, gastrointestinal, gynaecological and pain and fever medications continues to exert pressure on IPM growth while growth in select chronic therapies such as cardiac and diabetes has made a good recovery. The new launches were mostly related to Covid-19 related drugs and the price growth has remained in the region of 4-5 percent. The volume growth remains tepid at about 6.9 percent in November 2020.    How will it be in 2021?  There were some positive things that have happened in the pharma industry in 2020. The use of digital to reach out to doctors and reduction in selling, travel and promotional expenses. Analysts say the industry has saved about 6-7 percent on expenses, which directly add to their profit margins. While in 2021, these savings might not sustain fully when normalcy returns, but still, analysts expect some of those savings would be permanent. The adoption of telemedicine by doctors and hospitals is also seen as positive.  The pharmaceutical sector is expecting the sales to normalise by the second half of 2021, with the availability of vaccine and Covid-19 receding. Hospitals and physician clinics have started to function. Many hospital beds in both government and private that were converted for treating Covid patients exclusively are reclaimed by non-Covid patients. While the pharmaceutical industry has certainly performed better than many other sectors, given the essential nature of medicines. But even this industry is pinning its hopes on the end of the pandemic.","Business, Cipla, Companies, coronavirus, Glenmark, Health, stocks, Year-ender 2020","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/viswanath-pilla-6848/', 'name': 'Viswanath Pilla'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/will-normalcy-return-to-covid-hit-indian-pharmaceutical-market2021_14625961.html
