835,2021-01-19 07:17:50+05:30,Bajaj Finserv Ltd.,BAJAJFINSV,Hot Stocks | Here are three trading calls for the short term,India VIX is trading near its 6-month high which shows the high level of fear in the market after a prolonged uptrend.,"  From the all-time high of 14,653, Nifty has witnessed a correction of almost 3 percent towards 14,222.  In the week ended January 15, 2021, Nifty formed a Doji candlestick pattern on the weekly chart. Doji indicates indecision and also the reversal in the trend if the low of the candle is breached decisively.  In the first session of this week, we have seen Nifty breaking the crucial support of 14,357, which confirms the bearish trend reversal.  Nifty has been trading in the upward sloping channel. It took resistance on the upper trendline of the channel and reversed south.  The lower trendline of the channel projects the support around 14,150, below which medium-term trend could go in favour of the bears.  RSI oscillator on the daily charts has exited the overbought zone with negative crossover on its signal line.  The MACD indicator has also shown a bearish crossover on the daily chart. These technical developments confirm the downtrend in the short-term.  India VIX is trading near its 6-month high which shows the high level of fear in the market after a prolonged uptrend.  Bank Nifty has witnessed significant build-up on the short side. Bank Nifty has formed a bearish double top formation near its previous all-time high of 32,613.  The weekly chart of the banking index has also formed a Doji candlestick after a sharp rally.  The 20-day MA support for the Nifty is currently placed at 14,088. Support of 20-day MA has not been violated on a closing basis since November 4, 2020.  This support also coincides with the support of the upward sloping channel. So a close below 14,088 would result in the medium-term down-trend for Nifty and in that case, the recent top of 14,653 would remain as an intermediate top.  Here are three sell calls for the next 2-3 weeks:  Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra Financial Services January Future | Target price: Rs 160 | Stop loss: Rs 185  This stock has breached the crucial support of 8, 13 and 21 days EMA.  It has also broken down from the upward sloping trendline. Indicators and oscillators have turned bearish on the short term charts.  Moreover, the NBFC sector has started showing weakness.  IndiGo January Future | Target price: Rs 1,500 | Stop loss: Rs 1,670  Bearish double-top formation at Rs 1,780 odd levels is formed on the daily chart.  An ascending triangle breakdown is seen on the daily chart.  The stock has breached the crucial support of its 50 days EMA. It has been forming a lower top and lower bottom formation on the hourly charts.  The stock is trading below its 5, 10, 20 and 50 days EMA. Indicators and oscillators like RSI, DMI and MACD have turned bearish on the short-term charts.  Bajaj Finserv January Future | Target price: Rs 7,950 | Stop loss: Rs 8,650  This stock has recently violated the crucial support placed near Rs 8,630 levels.  Lower top and lower bottom formation have taken shape on the daily chart after a long time.  The short-term moving averages have given negative crossover on medium to long-term moving averages, which indicates the downtrend for the stock.  Indicators have turned bearish on the daily and weekly charts.

Brent prices have risen to USD65/bbl, driven by demand recovery, OPEC+ cuts, stimulus and extreme cold weather. Arrival of summer-driving season in US-Europe and shift to personal mobility should support oil prices further. Hence, there is upside risk to our USD55/bbl Brent assumption for FY22. Subsidy risk based on Union Budget and LPG price hikes is low in our view. ONGC management has remained upbeat on the government agreeing to remunerative gas pricing, which should at least cover the USD3.5-3.7/mmbtu cost of production. Every USD1/mmbtu rise in APM rate implies Rs2.6/sh EPS increase for the company.  Outlook We value ONGC at 4x FY23E EV/EBITDA to arrive at Rs130 TP, assuming USD2.3/2.7 APM prices for FY22/23.

SBI Life Insurance was set up in 2001 as a joint venture between State Bank of India and BNP Paribas Cardiff. It debuted on the domestic bourses in October 2017.  On December 4, 2020, Moneycontrol was the first to report that BNP Paribas Cardiff was evaluating the sale of its balance stake in SBI Life Insurance via a block deal.  &ldquo;BNP Paribas has launched the block deal today,&rdquo; an individual told Moneycontrol. A second individual confirmed the same.  According to the current shareholding pattern, the French firm, which falls in the promoter category, holds 5.2 percent stake which is valued at Rs 4,888 crore at current market price. The SBI Life Insurance stock had hit 52-week high earlier this week after registering a strong growth in new business premiums in February.  Both the individuals above spoke to Moneycontrol on the condition of anonymity. Moneycontrol could not immediately connect with BNP Paribas Cardiff and SBI Life Insurance for an immediate comment.  According to the terms of the deal accessed by Bloomberg, BNP Paribas is selling 35 million (or around 3.5 percent) SBI Life Insurance shares which are being offered at Rs 870 to Rs 917 each. This represents a 2.5 percent to 7.5 percent discount to MArch 9&rsquo;s closing price of Rs 940.75.  There is an option to increase the deal size by about 15 million shares (1.5 percent) and BNP Paribas is the sole broker on the deal. If the upsize option is exercised, then BNP Paribas would be left with a miniscule 0.2 percent stake.  The BNP Paribas-SBI Life Saga  BNP Paribas, which is a specialist in personal insurance and had gross written premiums of 29.8 billion euros in 2019 has been gradually paring its stake in SBI Life Insurance over the last few years.  In June 2019, BNP Paribas Cardiff had offloaded 2.5 percent stake in SBI Life Insurance for about Rs 1,625 crore. Earlier, In March 2019, it had sold 5 percent and 9.2 percent for Rs 2,889 crore and Rs 4,751 crore, respectively, in the life insurer.  Commanding an individual market share of 11.7 percent, by the end of the first half of this fiscal year, SBI Life Insurance is a market leader and has recently seen an improvement in business premium, policy retention and the ULIP business.  An earlier report by brokerage firm Motilal Oswal had said: &ldquo;We expect SBI Life Insurance to continue to deliver good persistency and renewal growth. At the same time, it should maintain its cost leadership.&rdquo;  BNP Paribas Cardiff is a leading global player in bancassurance partnerships and creditor insurance.

ONGC''s output dropped to 43.54 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas in 2015-16 (62.9 per cent of India''s total production) but new discoveries as well as massive investment in extracting last drop from the ageing fields arrested further fall and even led to a marginal increase.  Even when its production dropped when compared to previous year, ONGC''s share in total production of crude oil and natural gas in the country continued to rise, the data which formed part of the review taken by the ministry a couple of weeks back, showed.  ONGC is focused on finding oil and gas reserves in Category II and III Basins, which do not have established hydrocarbon proficiency.  This helped accrete inplace reserves of 2,246 million tonnes of oil between 2002 and 2015 and ultimate accretion of 1,014 million tonnes, the data presented at the review showed.  Of this, ONGC realised 830 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas as production. It has approved 14 schemes for developing 135 million tonnes of reserves.  ONGC''s share in national production rose from 52.8 per cent in 2010-11 to 54.9 per cent in the following year and to 58.7 per cent in 2012-13, 62.2 per cent in 2013-14, 62.3 per cent in 2014-15, 62.9 per cent in 2015-16 and 65.3 per cent in 2016-17.  In subsequent years it was 67 per cent, 68.4 per cent and 70.3 per cent in 2019-20 -- the latest year for which data was presented at the review.  During this 10-year period, India''s dependence on imported crude oil to meet its demand rose from about two-third to 85 per cent.  ONGC discovered and put to production seven out of the eight producing basins of India covering 83 per cent of established oil and gas reserves.  In December last year, it opened India''s eighth hydrocarbon producing basin when it started oil flow from a well in the Bengal basin. Oil India Ltd (OIL) is responsible for putting into production one basin in Assam.","Business, Companies, gas, ONGC","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/ongc39s-shareindia39s-oil-gas-production-jumps-to-7053-10-years-back_14932741.html

851,2021-04-12 17:24:12+05:30,Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd.,ONGC,"ONGC seeks buyers for KG gas, wants minimum $6.6 price","According to the tender document, ONGC intends to start natural gas sale from its KG-DWN-98/2 block, which sits next to Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL)-BP Plc operated KG-D6 fields, from June-end.","State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) on Monday invited bids for the sale of initial 2 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from its KG basin fields at a minimum price of USD 6.6 per mmBtu.  According to the tender document,&nbsp;ONGC&nbsp;intends to start natural gas sale from its KG-DWN-98/2 block, which sits next to Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL)-BP Plc operated KG-D6 fields, from June-end. Initially, 2 million standard cubic metres per day of gas has been offered for sale through an e-auction.  ONGC&nbsp;has sought bids indexed to Brent crude oil. Bids have been sought at a minimum of 10.5 per cent of the three-month average Brent crude oil price.  At the current Brent crude oil price of USD 63, the minimum price comes to USD 6.6 per million British thermal unit.  This price, however, will be subject to the ceiling or cap fixed by the government for deepsea fields every six months. The cap for six months beginning April 1 is USD 3.62 per mmBtu.  This essentially means that bidders may corner gas by offering to pay USD 7, but the buyers will have to pay no more than the ceiling price of USD 3.62.  A senior&nbsp;ONGC&nbsp;official said the ceiling price is expected to rise to USD 5.5-5.6 at the next revision due on October 1.  &amp;quot;The current ceiling price is one-third less than the bare minimum cost of production from a deepsea field. After including the cost of money as well as margin, gas price should be USD 6 and not USD 3.62,&amp;quot; he said.  Earlier this month, Reliance Industries Ltd and its partner BP Plc of UK sought bids for the sale of 5.5 mmscmd of additional natural gas that will be available for sale from their eastern offshore KG-D6 block.  The e-auction is slated for April 23 and the gas supply will start from late April or early May, according to the tender document.  Bidders will have to quote a price linked to Platts JKM (Japan Korea marker) - the liquefied natural gas (LNG) benchmark price assessment for spot physical cargoes.  The lowest bid that can be placed is JKM minus USD 0.3 per million British thermal unit. The highest acceptable bid would be JKM plus USD 2.01 per mmBtu.  This is the same benchmark RIL-BP had used in February to sell out 7.5 mmscmd of gas from the block.  At the current price, the lowest price for the 5.5 mmscmd of gas that RIL-BP are auctioning comes to near USD 6.5 per mmBtu.  But just like ONGC, RIL-BP too is entitled to a maximum of USD 3.62 per mmBtu ceiling fixed by the government for a six-month period to September 30.  ONGC's KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 block is expected to have a peak production rate of 15.25 mmscmd of natural gas and 80,000 barrels per day of oil.  The company is likely to come out with another tender later this year for the sale of 5 mmscmd of gas from next year.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Disclaimer:&nbsp;&ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;","Business, Krishna-Godavari basin, ONGC","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/ongc-seeks-buyers-for-kg-gas-wants-minimum-3666-price_15002441.html

On the option open interest front, huge participation and open interest addition are seen at 14,500 calls.  On the Put side, open interest addition is seen at 13,550 strike. So, going ahead, we can expect the broader range of the Nifty to be between 14,500-13,550.

The MACD plotted on the daily and the weekly timeframe can be seen moving higher, indicating the presence of bullishness in the trend.  The RSI placed above the 50-mark and moving higher indicates the presence of momentum in the bullish trend.

The initial rollout will begin in Hyderabad on May 17 and will be extended to Visakhapatnam and other metro cities starting May 18.","Dr Reddy's on May 17 said 8-9 states have approached the company for&nbsp;procurement of Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine. The company named Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, among the states that have reached out to them.  Dr Reddy's had announced that the imported doses of Russia's Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine have been priced at Rs 948 plus 5 percent GST or Rs 995.40 per dose. It said the price of the imported Sputnik V vaccine would remain the&nbsp;same for the government and private channels.  The company would be working with hospitals in metros that can handle -18 degrees Centigrade storage for the vaccines.  Dr Reddy's has received 1.5 lakh doses of Sputnik first dose last week, the company said it has received the second consignment of 60,000 doses second dose during the weekend.  &amp;quot;We have a supply commitment of 36 million doses from RDIF in the next two months,&amp;quot; said M V Ramana, CEO of Branded Formulations at Dr Reddy's.  Ramana said Dr Reddy's is trying to secure more doses from RDIF. The company has a commitment from RDIF to get 250 million doses of Sputnik V first and second dose.&nbsp;About 15-20 percent of the initial supplies will be imported&nbsp;from Russia.  Dr Reddy's said once the local manufactures begin supplying, which is expected in the next two to three months, the&nbsp;vaccine prices will come down.  &amp;quot;They have to absorb the technology from RDIF, have to get approvals from the regulators and then scale up manufacturing,&amp;quot;&nbsp; said&nbsp;Sauri Gudlavalleti - Head Of Research And Development.  &amp;quot;We are working with the regulator to bring appropriate guidance, on whether the other Indian suppliers with whom RDIF signed supply agreement will have to do clinical trials or not,&amp;quot;&nbsp;Gudlavalleti added.  Hetero that has a tie-up with RDIF has got permission from DCGI to conduct Phase-3 trials of Sputnik V vaccine.  Gudlavalleti said the company intends to reach&nbsp;out to the Indian drug regulator in the next few weeks seeking emergency use authorisation of Sputnik Light single-dose vaccine.  Apollo Hospitals tie-up  Dr Reddy's&nbsp;on Monday announced a partnership with Apollo Hospitals&nbsp;to do the trial rollout of the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine in India.  Dr Reddy's will use the services of the Apollo Hospitals network nationally in storage, transportation, administering and monitoring of people who get vaccinated.

The company will use its understanding of the global supply chain and logistics to procure one lakh oxygen concentrators on behalf of the government of India, ONGC said in a statement.  The government of India will bear the cost of procuring these concentrators.  &amp;quot;Within a short period, ONGC placed orders for 34,673 oxygen concentrators on overseas vendors for immediate supply. Out of these, 2,900 are expected to be received by May 21, and the rest in staggered delivery from May to the end of June 2021.  &amp;quot;Further, to promote domestic capacity, the order has been placed for 40,000 units of oxygen concentrators on domestic manufacturers,&amp;quot; it said  In addition, medical-grade oxygen generation plants are also being set up with ONGC support in 10 government hospitals in three states.  This is part of the 93 oxygen plants oil PSUs are setting up across the country.  &amp;quot;Continuing its fight against COVID, ONGC has been an active part of the nation-wide vaccination drive promoting the vaccination efforts through regular social media posts. ONGC is also organizing vaccination camps at various work locations across the country for employees and secondary workforce,&amp;quot; it said.

872,2021-05-21 12:02:54+05:30,Hindalco Industries Ltd.,HINDALCO,"Hindalco likely to report strong earnings in Q4 backed by Novelis, Aleris performance",Kotak expects aluminum EBITDA (including Utkal) to increase 12 percent QoQ and 55 percent YoY due to higher volumes and higher aluminum prices.,"Aluminium and copper major Hindalco Industries is likely to report strong earnings growth in the quarter ended March 2021, backed by Novelis and Aleris performance. Both are expected to contribute majorly to operating performance of the company, experts feel.  According to brokerages, the Aditya Birla Group company is expected to report more than 100 percent growth in Q4 profit with strong double digit growth in EBITDA and revenue, compared to year-ago period.  Novelis Inc, the world leader in aluminum rolling and recycling, already reported its quarterly earnings on May 12, saying the net income (profit) attributable to its common shareholder of $176 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 grew by 179 percent YoY.  &amp;quot;Net sales increased 33 percent over the prior year to $3.6 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily driven by a 21 percent increase in shipments, favourable product mix and higher average aluminum prices,&amp;quot; said Novelis in its filing.  &amp;quot;Total flat rolled product shipments increased to 983 kilotonnes, mainly reflecting the addition of the acquired Aleris business and record automotive and beverage can shipments, as well as continued strong demand for building and construction and other specialty flat rolled aluminum products,&amp;quot; it added.  Novelis' adjusted EBITDA increased 32 percent to $505 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 YoY due to higher organic volume, favourable metal benefits, and a $60 million positive EBITDA contribution from the acquired Aleris business.  On the domestic operations front, the operating performance is expected to be supported by higher commodity prices in the international markets with strong aluminium business, but copper is likely to see the impact of lower volumes due to maintenance shutdown during quarter.  To Know All Earnings Related News, Click Here  &amp;quot;We estimate India EBITDA (standalone + Utkal) to rise 36 percent YoY or 12 percent QoQ on higher commodity prices and higher volumes in aluminum (up 4 percent YoY and 3 percent QoQ) offset by lower volumes in copper (down 2 percent YoY, and up 16 percent QoQ),&amp;quot; said Kotak Institutional Equities which sees 116 percent year-on-year growth in Hindalco's Q4 profit, 33 percent rise in revenue, and 36 percent growth in EBITDA.  Kotak expects aluminum EBITDA (including Utkal) to increase 12 percent QoQ and 55 percent YoY due to higher volumes and higher aluminum prices. In case of copper, the brokerage sees EBITDA declining 24 percent YoY and rising 14 percent QoQ, impacted by lower volumes offset by higher copper prices.  ICICI Direct, too, expects Hindalco's domestic operations (standalone operations + Utkal) topline to increase 33 percent YoY and 17 percent QoQ. &amp;quot;Topline could have been higher but was restricted due to hedging around 58 percent of volume at lower LME price ($1716 per tonne),&amp;quot; said the brokerage, adding EBITDA growth is likely to come in at 18 percent YoY and 13 percent QoQ.  In case of volumes front, ICICI Direct expects Hindalco to report aluminium sales volume of around 3,25,000 tonnes (3,14,000 in Q4FY20 and 3,15,000 in Q3FY21) and copper sales of around 85,000 tonnes (73,000 tonnes in Q3FY21 and 86,000 tonnes in Q4FY20).  &amp;quot;We expect Hindalco to report aluminium volumes at 3,24,000 tonnes and copper volumes at 76,000 tonnes for the March quarter,&amp;quot; said Motilal Oswal which sees 104 percent YoY growth in profit and 18.3 percent increase in topline.","Hindalco Industries, Result Poll","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/result-poll/hindalco-likely-to-report-strong-earningsq4-backed-by-novelis-aleris-performance_15104681.html
873,2021-05-21 15:06:15+05:30,SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd.,SBILIFE,"Online sales, contactless underwriting game changer for insurance sector in COVID times","Since people are reluctant to venture out of homes, video medical tests are the norm now. There is a questionnaire for potential policy buyers and customers are asked 4-5 COVID- related questions. For COVID-recovered customers, there could be a cooling-off period of 3-6 months.","An insurance agent visiting your home/office, getting multiple documents signed and medical tests were the standard operating procedure (SOP) for getting an insurance policy in India. However, a lot has changed now.  From April 2020, after the nationwide lockdown was announced, insurance companies had to quickly devise ways to issue paperless policies without compromising on their underwriting rules.  This led to a slew of changes in the way policies were sold and delivered. Know-Your-Customer (KYC) procedures became completely digitised, COVID-19 related questions gained prominence and medical underwriting happened via video calls.  For COVID-recovered customers, there could be a cooling-off period of 3-6 months, only after which an insurance policy is issued. As reported by Moneycontrol earlier, vaccination certificates could also become a must-have to get a policy and help you get discounts.  COVID-19 questionnaire and test reports  Sachin Dutta, Chief Operating Officer, Canara HSBC OBC Life Life Insurance, said that at the time of onboarding itself, customers are asked 4-5 COVID- related questions.  The questions relate to international travel in the past 2-3 months, duration, purpose and name of destination. Plans and purpose of future travel are also sought.  Dutta said that customers are also asked to disclose if they currently have any flu-like symptoms such as cold, persistent cough, running nose, headache and fever. Those testing positive for COVID-19 have to provide all reports.  Since there were a lot of queries about how to disclose COVID-19 status and whether their claims would be impacted by the virus, insurers are now starting to have standardised forms for disclosure.  Anand Pejawar, President-Operations, IT &amp;amp;amp; International Business, SBI Life Insurance, said that the COVID-specific questionnaire was introduced after the company started getting a lot of queries from on how to disclose their status and how claims would get impacted.  The questions would be around COVID-19, home quarantine and hospitalisation. Details of vaccination and foreign travel also have to be explicitly disclosed.  &ldquo;SBI Life has also formulated guidelines on how to underwrite cases after recovery, and what should be the waiting period. It has served us well as we have been able to take care of the increased demand for insurance in the wake of the pandemic as well as to allay customer fears about policy validity and claim settlements,&rdquo; he added.  Since the vaccination drive from February 2021, customers not wanting to take the vaccine may also find it tough to buy insurance. Those vaccinated with both the shots will find it easier to buy term plans, said industry sources.  Lalitha Bhatia, Chief Operating Officer, Ageas Federal Life Insurance, said that, since April 2020, certain COVID-19-related changes had been implemented in the underwriting guidelines, with the COVID questionnaire becoming a mandatory document at the time of policy purchase.  From January 2021, Bhatia added that the guidelines have been slightly relaxed on account of vaccination, which now forms a part of the COVID questionnaire.  On the non-life side, pre-existing diseases are to be disclosed. The waiting period depends on the age and the policy chosen. Hence those who had undergone treatment for COVID-19 also have to disclose details of hospitalisation and home treatment for medical insurance.  Sanjay Datta, Chief, Underwriting, Claims and Reinsurance, ICICI Lombard General Insurance, said that it would be prudent for customers to declare pre-existing diseases.  &amp;quot;We urge customers to declare if they have received treatment for any condition or symptom(s)/ have undergone hospitalisation for any illness/surgery/ or currently taking medication(s) for any condition or medical procedures. Customers are also urged to declare any diagnostic tests they may have undergone in the past as all these details are significant for our medical team to grade the risk,&rdquo; he added.  Medical tests go digital with lockdown  When it comes to insurance policies, companies would insist on getting a thorough medical check-up to ensure that the pricing of a product is done as per risk norms. Acceptance of an insurance risk is also determined by how healthy an individual is.  Amidst COVID-19 and the resultant lockdown, getting medical tests done was not possible. So that is being replaced by video medical tests.  Pejawar of SBI Life said that, at the company, there are large non-medical limits followed by limits for tele-verifications. Medical tests are not mandatory in a large number of cases, he added.  Telephone-based verification is more common. This is where a medical professional would get on a call with the proposed policyholder and assess his/her health conditions.  Mayank Bathwal, CEO, Aditya Birla Health Insurance, said that pre-policy assessment is made more customer-friendly as they have deployed tele-underwriting. So potential customers need not undergo physical tests for most of the products.  &amp;quot;As a majority of the test centres were closed during lockdown and customers were hesitant to go for medicals, we have waived off medical tests and replaced them with tele-medical underwriting for most of our products. Customers can easily sit in the comfort of their homes and provide us with the required risk- related data,&amp;quot; he added.  At ICICI Lombard, Datta said that medical tests are currently determined on the basis of the customer&rsquo;s age, sum insured opted for and pre-existing illnesses disclosed. It is not mandatory for all new policies.  Some insurers are adopting a wait-and-watch approach. Suresh Agarwal, MD &amp;amp;amp; CEO, Kotak Mahindra General Insurance, said motor business is slowing down while health insurance is growing.  &ldquo;As far as our underwriting practices are concerned, we are yet to make any changes in our approach like mandatory pre-medicals. The rise in claims cost needs to be looked at from a portfolio level rather than policy level. We are monitoring the situation and will take an appropriate call as it progresses,&rdquo; he added.  Medical insurance claims worth Rs 9,000 crore have been settled so far by non-life insurers. Life insurers have settled COVID-related death claims worth close to Rs 2,060 crore so far.","Business, Economy, insurance","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/m-saraswathy-6837/', 'name': 'M Saraswathy'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/online-sales-contactless-underwriting-game-changer-for-insurance-sectorcovid-times_15105101.html

Novelis' net income (excluding tax-effected special items) was at $172 million, up 12 percent YoY, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization associated with the acquisition of Aleris.  Revenue at $3.6 billion grew 33 percent YoY, due to higher shipments, global aluminium prices and market premiums, said the company, adding total shipments of flat rolled products (FRPs) were at an all-time high of 983 Kt, growing 21 percent YoY, with the addition of the acquired Aleris business and strong demand across end-product markets.  Hindalco said aluminium India business' EBITDA was at an all-time high of Rs 1,610 crore in Q4FY21, rising 54 percent YoY, primarily due to favourable macros, better operational efficiencies and lower input costs, and EBITDA margin of 27 percent was the highest in the last 12 quarters and continued to be amongst the best in the industry.

In case of copper business, which contributed 21 percent to total business, the revenue at Rs 8,508 crore in Q4FY21 grew by 80 percent YoY, primarily due to higher global prices of copper, but EBITDA at Rs 269 crore fell 33.7 percent YoY.

JSW's interest, which extends to plants including Gupta's Adhunik steel mill in eastern India, could mark yet another chapter for Britain's steel industry, which has been privatised and sold to overseas buyers as its pre-eminence slid in lock-step with the country's manufacturing might.  In a statement on Saturday, JSW Steel said its focus remained in India for now and it was not looking at acquiring any overseas assets.  A sale would chip away at Gupta's sprawling network of businesses, comprising hundreds of privately held companies with interests spanning steel, aluminium, mining, financial services and real estate, built up over years of acquisitions.  Gupta has been scrambling to refinance after his go-to source of funding, British supply chain finance firm Greensill, filed for insolvency in March. Britain's Serious Fraud Office said this month that it was investigating Gupta's businesses, including their links to Greensill.  Although JSW Steel, part of the metals-to-cement conglomerate JSW Group controlled by billionaire Sajjan Jindal, was interested in bidding, one of the sources said, there were obstacles to any deal, including navigating the fallout from Brexit as well as India's coronavirus crisis.  And no final decision had been taken on whether to bid for what the source described as a &amp;quot;surprise package&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;The due diligence has not yet started. After Brexit, it will not be easy to operate these assets,&amp;quot; he said.  A spokesman for GFG said it &amp;quot;continues to serve its customers around the world and is making progress in the refinancing of its operations, which are benefiting from the operational improvements it has made and the very strong steel, aluminium and iron ore markets.&amp;quot;  Gupta was lauded as the saviour of steel in Britain who bought distressed assets in economically deprived areas. His group has 35,000 workers, including 5,000 in Britain, and annual revenues of $20 billion.  UK 'MONITORING DEVELOPMENTS'  Any change of ownership of Liberty Steel, which employs around 3,000 people in Britain, will be politically sensitive.  Darren Jones, who chairs the UK parliament's business, energy and industrial strategy committee, said he expected any buyer to require ministerial clearance.  &amp;quot;Steel production can also be considered to be an important part of our economic resilience and national security,&amp;quot; he said.  The government said it was &amp;quot;closely monitoring developments around Liberty Steel and continues to engage closely with the company, the broader UK steel industry and trade unions&amp;quot;.  Private equity investor Endless and China's Jingye Group, which owns British Steel, were also interested in Gupta's business in Britain, said people familiar with the matter.  Separately, commodity trader Trafigura has expressed an interest in investing in GFG's aluminium smelter at Dunkirk in France, which is Europe's largest, said one source.  JSW and Endless did not respond to requests for comment and Jingye's British Steel declined to comment. Trafigura, which provided a loan to GFG's Liberty House to help finance Dunkirk's purchase in 2018, declined to comment.  Gupta bought the smelter for $500 million from Rio Tinto.","Business, JSW Steel, Liberty Steel, Sanjeev Gupta","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/reuters-6885/', 'name': 'Reuters'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/india39s-jsw-steel-examining-bid-for-sanjeev-gupta39s-british-business-report_15106701.html

884,2021-06-02 17:56:24+05:30,Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd.,APOLLOHOSP," COVID-19 vaccination becomes more convenient as pvt hospitals, labs, pharmacy chains reach out to...",Apollo Hospitals has completed 1 million vaccinations across 80 locations in India so far. It plans to make it into a million every week in June and double that in July. Karnataka permits even diagnostic chains. Only problem is that there is no cap on the vaccine administration fee.,"Rajesh Murthy* who lives in one of the largest residential gated communities in Bannerghatta in Bengaluru got his second dose of COVID-19 vaccination at the premises of his apartments.  &ldquo;Last time, we had to go to a hospital and wait in a queue to get the first dose. This time, it is very smooth and convenient,&rdquo; Murthy said.  Murthy got his jab at the vaccination drive conducted by Apollo Hospitals, Bannerghatta.  Apollo Hospitals has been working closely with apartment associations and resident welfare associations in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Navi Mumbai and other cities for onsite administration of COVID-19 vaccines.  Apollo, on May 27, said it has completed 1 million vaccinations across 80 locations in India. It plans to make this a million every week in June and double that in July.  &ldquo;We are on track to complete 20 million jabs by September 2021,&rdquo; Shobana Kamineni, Executive Vice-Chairperson, Apollo Group of Hospitals, recently said.  The Union government has liberalised the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines from May 1 by allowing private hospitals and corporates to directly buy vaccines from manufacturers and administer them to people.  Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech have fixed the price of their vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, at Rs 600 and Rs 1,200, respectively. Dr Reddy's has fixed Sputnik V price at Rs 995 per dose, including GST.  No cap on administration fee  While there is no cap on how much a hospital can charge as administration fee, most large private hospitals are charging between Rs 200 and Rs 300 over and above the procurement cost of the vaccine.  For onsite vaccination, hospitals are charging an extra Rs 200 - Rs 300 per dose, but people, especially senior citizens, who are not able to travel to the vaccination centres or are finding it difficult to use the CoWIN platform, are not minding the extra price due to the convenience onsite vaccination offers.  Some hospitals have started drive-in vaccinations, and others are considering vaccinating people at their homes. However, there are risks to both.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Karnataka permits diagnostic chains as well  Currently, states have allowed only private hospitals to do inoculations. But Karnataka permitted even diagnostic chains such as Metropolis to do inoculation through camps and vaccine centres.  &amp;quot;We are already giving vaccinations in Bengaluru; it is a state decision. Most other states have allowed only hospitals. Karnataka allowed certain diagnostic labs. They gave us permission,&amp;quot; Metropolis Managing Director Ameera Shah said.  &amp;quot;Right now, there is no vaccine available. It will become available next month or so. We are in talks with manufacturers to directly procure vaccines. We have 2,500 centres and home services capability. If vaccines are available and states permit us, we can do tens of thousands of inoculations per day,&amp;quot; Shah said.  Even e-pharmacies like Pharmeasy, 1 mg, and Practo, among others, have plans to start COVID-19 vaccination.  While many states are not allowing home vaccinations due to concerns of vaccine wastage, delays in reaching the health facility in case of an adverse event and the challenges in maintaining the protocol of patient observation for 30 minutes after vaccination pose a problem to many.  Business case  At least for the next two years, COVID-19 vaccinations are expected to become an important revenue stream for private hospitals. Moneycontrol learns that a private hospital would make anywhere between Rs 150 - Rs 200 per every vaccination. According to an April 21 note from Jefferies India, private vaccinations can generate up to $1.4 billion in revenues in FY22.  Max Healthcare, which is doing 40,000-50,000 vaccinations per day, is excited about the opportunity.  &ldquo;There are positive opportunities from both the cash flow and profitability standpoint, simply because the private healthcare sector is permitted to charge what it wishes,&amp;quot; said Abhay Soi, Chairman and Managing Director, Max Hospitals, at the company's earnings call.  &ldquo;On the back of this opportunity, we have a tremendous amount of consultations, antibody tests and so on and so forth. The size of the opportunity I believe is immense. It is only constrained by the number of vaccines available. The situation is expected to improve over the next few weeks,&amp;quot; Soi said.  Soi says as more private participants enter, it will drive down administration charges.","Business, Companies, coronavirus","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/viswanath-pilla-6848/', 'name': 'Viswanath Pilla'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/covid-19-vaccination-becomes-more-convenient-as-pvt-hospitals-labs-pharmacy-chains-reach-out-to-customers_15151641.html

On the Put side, the highest participation is seen at 15,500 and 15,400 contracts. Thus, we can expect the broader range of the index to be 16,100-15,400.

The distance between the two moving averages can be seen increasing, indicating rising bullish momentum in the trend.  Going ahead, 15,660 (June 1 high) will act as a key resistance level.

On the indicator front, prices have been riding the upper Bollinger band for the past few months and have been placed above the 20-week SMA since October 2020.  The RSI, which was previously hovering around the 50-mark, can be seen rising since then, indicating the bulls have taken control of the trend.  The level of Rs 836 (38.2 percent extension level of the rise from Rs 500-885 projected from Rs 690) will act as a key resistance level.  If prices manage to break above this level, we may see them move higher and test Rs 882 (50 percent extension level of the rise from Rs 500-885 projected from Rs 690) and eventually towards Rs 927 (61.8 percent extension level of the rise from Rs 500-885 projected from Rs 690).

RSI plotted on the daily and the weekly charts can be seen placed above the 50-mark and moving higher, indicating the presence of bullish momentum in the trend.  Going ahead, Rs 222 (previous swing high) will act as a make-or-break level.  If the price sustains, we can see it move higher and test Rs 237 (multiple touchpoint level) and eventually towards Rs 250 (February 17, 2021).  The key level to watch out for on the downside is Rs 184 (20-week SMA), followed by Rs 163 (recent swing low).

The Stochastics plotted on the weekly timeframe can be seen moving higher, indicating increasing bullish momentum in the prices.  Going ahead, Rs 282 (100 percent extension level of the rise from Rs 143-238 projected from Rs 187) will act as a make or break level.

886,2021-06-07 20:20:14+05:30,Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd.,APOLLOHOSP,Private hospitals divided on Rs 150 cap on COVID-19 vaccine administration charges,"Corporate hospital chains such as Apollo, Max Healthcare, Fortis Healthcare, Narayana Health and Manipal Hospitals have shown huge interest in offering COVID-19 vaccination.","Private Hospitals are divided on Rs 150 cap on COVID-19 vaccine administration charges by the central government.  Apollo Hospitals, India largest hospital chain, said that the Rs 150 cap on COVID-19 vaccine administration charges doesn't make any difference to their vaccination programme.  &amp;quot;We are doing this (COVID-19 vaccination) in the national interest,&amp;quot; Sangita Reddy, Joint Managing Director of Apollo Hospitals Enterprises, told CNBC-TV18  &amp;quot;It's fine, we will continue with the programme,&amp;quot; Reddy said.  Apollo Hospitals charges Rs 200 as administration fee per vaccination, which is over and above the procurement cost. Apollo has so far administered 1.2 million vaccine doses.  The Union government has liberalised the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines from May 1 by allowing private hospitals and corporates to directly buy vaccines from manufacturers and administer them to people.  In the private market Serum Institute of India's (SII) Covishield is sold at Rs 600 per dose, Bharat Biotech's Covaxin at Rs 1200 per dose and Dr Reddy's Sputnik V vaccine at Rs 995 per dose.  According to an April 21 note from Jefferies India, private vaccinations can generate up to $1.4 billion in revenues in FY22. COVID-19 vaccination is estimated to contribute about 5-10 percent of revenues for corporate hospital chains.  Large hospitals are hoping COVID-19 vaccination will benefit them in the long run as it will help them get higher consultations,&nbsp; cross-sell wellness packages and other things.  Corporate hospital chains like Apollo, Max Healthcare, Fortis Healthcare, Narayana Health and Manipal Hospitals, among others have taken a huge interest in offering COVID-19 vaccination.  Other hospital executives are not on the same page as Reddy of Apollo. They believe that Rs 150 is too low, with little scope for realisations.  &amp;quot;We are happy that the private sector role in this national program has been recognised by allocating 25 percent to the private sector,&amp;quot; Fortis said in a statement.  &amp;quot;Unfortunately, the cap of service charge at Rs. 150 will not cover the additional costs incurred for such offsite vaccination camps which involve substantial costs like Ambulance, transport, extra staff and doctor, plus TDS involved in many cases. We urge the govt to consider a higher charge for off-site vaccination camps to enable expanded coverage,&amp;quot; Fortis added.  Dr Alok Roy, Chairman of Kolkata-based Medica Superspecialty Hospital and also the Chair of FICCI health Services Committee, told Moneycontrol the capping administration charges is a &amp;quot;retrograde step&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;A uniform price cap of Rs 150 isn't a good thing, as price differs based on services and convenience. If you are providing vaccines in a comfortable air-conditioned environment, using best consumables, having skilled nurses and doctors at site, keeping an emergency ambulance and beds ready as part of the protocol, it will definitely cost higher,&amp;quot; Roy said.  &amp;quot;If the government wants to really subsidise the COVID-19 vaccination in the private sector, it should have capped the prices of COVID-19 vaccines. Why COVID-19 vaccines are so expensive for the private sector,&amp;quot; Roy added.  Another executive of a large private hospital chain, who didn't want to be named, told Moneycontrol that at least Rs 200 would have been an ideal price to keep&nbsp;the hospitals motivated to do more.  Please read here on how COVID-19 vaccination is becoming more convenient as&nbsp;private hospitals, labs&nbsp;and pharmacy chains reach out to customers through drive-ins and vaccination camps at offices and apartment complexes.  Rs 150 cap not bad  In contrast, Dr.Girdhar Gyani - Director General - Association of Healthcare Provider (AHPI), which represents smaller hospitals, nursing homes and clinics, welcomed the cap.  &amp;quot;AHPI from the beginning has been advocating for Rs 150 cap, the government finally realised. Some private hospitals took advantage of a free market, and were charging Rs 500-1000 as administration fee, which is unfair,&amp;quot; Gyani said.  Gyani alleges that the large private hospitals with financial muscle have cornered the COVID-19 vaccination in the private market, since it was open from May 1, and made a lot of money.  &amp;quot;COVID-19 vaccination is not the core business, this is just part of your CSR activity, why are they cribbing about the cap,&amp;quot; Gyani questions.  &amp;quot;It is high time government should think about ensuring vaccine supplies to smaller hospitals and clinics, so that they can take the COVID-19 vaccination to smaller towns, slums and rural areas,&amp;quot; Gyani added.","Business, Companies, coronavirus, Health","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/viswanath-pilla-6848/', 'name': 'Viswanath Pilla'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/private-hospitals-dividedrs-150-capcovid-19-vaccine-administration-charges_15165501.html

Shares of Adani Transmission, Adani Enterprises and Adani Power have jumped between 200 percent and 265 percent in the same period","Most Adani group stocks suffered losses in intraday trade on June 14 after media reports suggested that the National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) has frozen three Foreign Portfolio Investors' (FPIs) accounts that own shares in four of the listed Adani firms.  Shares of Adani Ports (down 8.36 percent), Adani Enterprises (down 6.26 percent), Adani Total Gas (down 5 percent), Adani Transmission (down 5 percent), Adani Power (down 5 percent) and Adani Green Energy (down 4.13 percent) all ended in the red.  Later in the day, Adani Enterprises issued a statement terming the media reports as&nbsp;erroneous.  &amp;quot;We bring to your kind attention, the news headlines published in ET that NSDL has frozen the accounts of 3 foreign funds-Albula Investment Fund, Cresta Fund and APMS Investment Fund holding shares in Adani Group Companies. We regret to mention that these reports are blatantly erroneous and are done to deliberately mislead the investing community. This is causing irreparable loss of economic value to the investors at large and reputation of the group,&amp;quot; Adani Enterprises said in a statement.  &amp;quot;Given the seriousness of the article and its consequential adverse impact on minority investors, we requested Registrar and Transfer Agent, with respect to the status of the Demat Account of the aforesaid funds and have their written confirmation vide its e-mail dated 14 June 2021, clarifying that the Demat Account in which the aforesaid funds hold the shares of the Company are not frozen,&amp;quot; the company's statement said.  Besides, Sebi is reportedly investigating whether there has been price manipulation in Adani Group stocks, which have gained between 200 and 1,000 percent in the last one year.&nbsp;Moneycontrol could not independently confirm the development.  Overall, the m-cap of Adani group stocks fell nearly Rs 54k crore today. However, Adani group stocks have been on a tear for over a year.

Analysts are now advising staying away from Adani group stocks.  &amp;quot;No fresh trades are advisable for now in Adani group stocks. As these shares are in control of the operators and the news is out, the risks are high. There can be unpredictable movements in either direction. Those who are trapped in long positions should wait patiently for a bounce to exit,&amp;quot; said Sanjeev Agarwal, Founder and CEO, Alpha Quantum Capital Management Ltd.  Yash Gupta, Equity Research Associate, Angel Broking pointed out as per the different market news some of the mutual funds are holding very large quantities of Adani groups stocks and some complaints have been filed with Sebi also.  &amp;quot;From today, four Adani group stocks have been shifted to T2T (trade 2 trade) which means that intraday trading will not be permitted and investors need to take or give holding for any trade,&amp;quot; said Gupta.  &amp;quot;We suggest investors be cautious on Adani group stocks, trading at very high valuations compared to peers. Buy on dips or averaging the buy position should be avoided for the time being,&amp;quot; Gupta said.  Gaurav Garg, Head of Research, CapitalVia Global Research points out investors should be cautious as most of the Adani group stocks are in the overbought zone and likely to consolidate in the next few months with profit-booking.  However, Garg said the structure is still intact and the charts still look bullish for long-term investment. Investors should look for any meaningful correction and add stocks in their portfolio in a staggered manner, he said.

Roy is also the chair of FICCI Health Services Committee.  &amp;quot;Once visa issuance is restarted, the first 5 lakh tourist visas will be issued free of charge,&amp;quot; the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.  &amp;quot;This benefit will be available only once per tourist,&amp;quot; Sitharaman clarified.  The scheme will be applicable till March 31, 2022 or till 5 lakh visa are issued, whichever is earlier. The government said the total financial implication will be around Rs 100 crore.  According to government, around 10.93 million foreign tourists visited India in 2019, spent about $30.098 billion on leisure, business and medical treatment. Average daily stay for a foreign tourist in India is 21 days. Averagae daily spending of a tourist in India is around $34 or Rs 2400. For large private hospital chains medical tourism over the years has become an important revenue stream with decent realisations.  The average revenue per occupied bed (ARPOB) from medical travelers is double than the local patient. Since most foreign patients meet the expense out-of-pocket, hospitals will get instant payment without relying on insurance, where the package rates are low and payments are delayed.  Big hospital chains like Apollo Hospitals, Fortis Healthcare, Max Healthcare, Aster DM Healthcare, Narayana Health among others are earning around high single to low teens from medical travelers.  According to EY, India has 38 Joint Commission International- accredited hospitals, the fourth highest after Brazil, Thailand and Turkey. The savings of&nbsp;medical treatment costs in India with respect to US, is the highest at 65-90 percent.  Medical tourism industry is growing at 18% CAGR year on year and is expected to be worth $9 billion by 2020  The major destination cities in India are Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Kolkata. A total of 27 percent of medical travellers visit Maharashtra out of which 80 percent goes to Mumbai, Chennai attracts nearly 15 percent while Kerala handles around 5-7 percent.","Business, Companies, Health","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/viswanath-pilla-6848/', 'name': 'Viswanath Pilla'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/medical-tourism-to-get-boostcentre39s-5-lakh-free-tourist-visa-scheme-say-experts_15237301.html

One of the problems companies face is that many have already committed money for the Indian Premier League, the remainder of which is scheduled from September. This leaves brands with a high cost commitment.","With eight days left for Tokyo Olympics to start airing on Sony Pictures Sports Network (SPSN) channels, the network is geared up to welcome sponsors and advertisers for the games. As many as 15 sponsors have come on board so far.  &ldquo;The co-presenting sponsors are Coca-Cola, Amul, JSW, MPL, and Hero MotoCorp. The associate sponsors include AMFI, RBI, Visa, Lenovo, Byju&rsquo;s, and Herbalife Nutrition. There are a lot of discussions happening as there is lot of time. Brands also come while the event is happening,&amp;quot; Rohit Gupta, SPNI, Chief Revenue Officer, Ad sales &amp;amp;amp; International Business, told Moneycontrol.  He added that the number of sponsors can go up to 20. Gupta said that the response from the advertisers has been strong.  It&rsquo;s not cricket all the way  &ldquo;The response for sports outside cricket has been increasing in the last few years. So that&rsquo;s been on an uptick now. Brands are looking at big and important global sporting events to advertise and we have seen this in the last four years and also saw this with Euro 2020,&amp;quot; he said.  Euro 2020 also saw strong response on the viewership front as, for the first 20 matches between June 12 and 18, UEFA Euro 2020 recorded 25 million viewers on TV, according to data shared by the Broadcast Audience Research Council India (BARC), a television audience measurement service. Euro 2020's total viewing minutes was 173 percent higher, as compared to the 2016 league.  Talking about Tokyo Olympics, Gupta said that though the youth watch the sports (Olympics), for advertisers, that is one segment which is very difficult to capture on television.  Difficult to make youth stay  &ldquo;Youth are jumping to different channels, they are jumping genres. Hence, it is very difficult to capture them. Yet, their engagement on sports is very high and advertisers&rsquo; interest in sports is really growing. For that segment (18-30), which is critical for advertisers, the best engagement is through sports,&rdquo; added Gupta.  So, what kind of ad inventory is the network offering?  Gupta explained that unlike cricket, where there's fixed inventory for a match, in Olympics, which goes on from morning till evening, they offer packages. &amp;quot;We offer packages and it can range from Rs 3-4 crore to Rs 8-10 crore.&amp;quot;  This means that advertising during Tokyo Olympics will need high investments from brands. But are brands ready for it?  According to analyst Karan Taurani, senior VP, Elara Capital, the demand will be good because last year we saw sporting events getting cancelled.  &amp;quot;So there will be revenge growth in sports on the ad revenue front. Calendar year 2021 will be good for sports. Brands that have youth appeal, including internet, e-commerce, discretionary and some part of auto, will show interest. So, there will be demand for sports advertising, and more so for Olympics because if you look at World Cup cricket, those are properties which have a high share in India because cricket and Bollywood is worshipped in India. As for Olympics, it is a global event,&amp;quot; he said.  Navin Kathuria, EVP - Planning and Buying, OMD Mudramax noted that sports in India has been considered a niche genre except for Cricket and to some extent Kabaddi in the past few years.  &amp;quot;Hence the response is always milder relative to other big ticket events. Having said that events with a global scale like Olympics does have its niche audiences and advertisers.&amp;quot;  Kathuria further said, &amp;quot;Though relatively lesser in numbers, there are corporates who will consider Olympic games for advertising. The sponsorship could be in different forms &ndash; encouraging the Indian athletes, congratulatory messages etc, apart from on-air sponsorship of the event. And these global sports events do attract a premium. For the channel, Olympic games is definitely a revenue boosting opportunity.&amp;quot;  Sai Srinivas, Trustee, MPL Sports Foundation and Co-Founder &amp;amp;amp; CEO, MPL, which is one of the sponsors of Tokyo Olympics, said that partnering with Sony, which enjoys a substantial and dedicated sports fan base, will help them reach the masses, and build engagement and excitement among all Indians around the games.  Good to associate, but RoI not promising  While Sony is betting big on the upcoming Tokyo Olympics, and it is estimated that the network is likely to earn around Rs 100 crore from sponsorships, Sandeep Goyal, Chairman Mogae Media, a Mumbai-based marketing and communication agency, said that viewership is scattered during Olympics and not fixed to one event.  &ldquo;So while many sponsors have supposedly signed up, the RoI (return on investment) is not very high. Good to associate but not a serious visibility window for brands,&rdquo; said Goyal.  Adding to this, Paritosh Joshi, Principal at Provocateur Advisory, an independent media and communications consultant, pointed out that many brands have already committed money for the Indian Premier League (IPL), the remainder of which is scheduled from September. And this leaves brands with a high cost commitment.  &ldquo;They (Sony) must have sold off key sponsorship inventory but the scattered ad inventory will be hard to sell,&rdquo; he said.  Nonetheless, the excitement for the games is high with India sending its largest ever contingent of athletes including 228 players for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics.  And Indian Olympics Association (IOA) President, Narinder Batra is expecting team India to record a double-digit medal tally at the games.  The games which will start from July 23 and will go on till August 8 will air on Sony Six, Sony Ten 2,&nbsp;Sony Ten 3 and Sony Ten 4 channels.  &amp;amp;nbsp;","2020 Tokyo Olympics, Business, Entertainment, Olympics 2020, Sports, Tokyo Olympics","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/maryam-farooqui-6835/', 'name': 'Maryam Farooqui'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/betting-bigtokyo-olympics-sony-pictures-signs-15-sponsorswill-advertisers-spend-money_15296661.html

Claims had increased manifold in the June quarter,"The second wave of COVID-19 and the looming threat of the third wave has severely hit large private life insurers, prompting them to shore up their provisions.  The two largest private insurers ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and HDFC Life Insurance have set aside additional provisions for COVID-19 claims.  HDFC Life Insurance has set aside an excess mortality reserve of Rs 700 crore created at the balance sheet for potential adverse mortality. This reserve is over and above the policy level liabilities calculated based on the applicable IRDAI regulations. This was in addition of Rs 165 crore of the provisions.  The company's solvency position remained at 203 percent in Q1 against the statutory minimum requirement of 150 percent.  In a report, Motilal Oswal Financial Services said quoting the HDFC Life management explained that peak claims during the second Covid wave were about 3-4 times of peak claim volumes in the first wave.  &amp;quot;The claims are still elevated compared to pre-Covid levels but are declining from as high as ~300 claims a day in Q1FY22 to now ~200 claims a day as the spread of the pandemic tapers,&amp;quot; said the Motilal Oswal report on HDFC Life.  ICICI Prudential Life Insurance posted a consolidated net loss of Rs 185.29 crore for the June quarter (Q1) on COVID-19 claims and provisions. The insurer had posted consolidated net profit of Rs 286.86 crore in the year-ago period.  Due to COVID-19 claims, the insurer is carrying Rs 498.29 crore as provisions for such claims at the end of the June quarter. In its investor presentation, the insurer said that it had Rs 1,119 crore of COVID-19 claims in Q1. Net of reinsurance the claims were Rs 500 crore.  It added in its investor presentation that the Q1FY22 net claims plus provisions held at June 2021 covers five times the net claims in FY21.  Moneycontrol had reported earlier how there is a mismatch between actual deaths and insurance claims. As per the RBI's financial stability report life insurance received 22,205 COVID-19 death claims worth Rs 1,644 crore during FY21.  Fears of third wave?  Motilal Oswal said in its report on HDFC Life that the rise in additional reserves is based on current expectation of extra claims to be received in future.  &amp;quot;HDFC Life Insurance saw higher COVID-19 claims and settled gross claims of Rs 1,600 crore (over 70,000) as claims during the second COVID wave have been 3&ndash;4x the peak claims seen during the first wave,&amp;quot; the report said. On ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, the report said that the insurer settled ~ Rs 1,120 crore in total claims on account of the pandemic in Q1FY22 (a 3.2x increase over FY21).

922,2021-07-22 12:21:38+05:30,HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd.,HDFCLIFE,HDFC Life Insurance to stay away from group term business,"The company has been cautious on the group term business due to pricing concerns, HDFC Life MD &amp;amp; CEO Vibha Padalkar said","HDFC Life Insurance is looking to stay from group term insurance business. This is on account of rising commoditisation of the product.  Vibha Padalkar, MD &amp;amp;amp; CEO, HDFC Life told analysts that the company has been cautious on the group protection business.  &amp;quot;We were doing risk-based underwriting rather than one-size-fits-all model. We stay away from group term insurance unless we understand the counterparty very well and are comfortable with the risk,&amp;quot; she added.  In Q1FY22, group protection business was Rs 740 crore compared to Rs 940 crore in FY20. FY21 saw the group protection business of Rs 250 crore, however this period was an aberration due to COVID-19 lockdown.  Explaining further, Padalkar said that group term has become a fairly commoditised product.  &amp;quot;We haven't been successful in making money there. It is because even one additional death can throw your pricing out of gear. So we have stayed away from that,&amp;quot; Padalkar&nbsp;added.  As a whole, Padalkar said that while growing protection isn't difficult, making reasonable returns in protection is fairly difficult. Hence, she suggested that a calibrated approach in this segment is the focus.  An Emkay Research report said that HDFC Life is avoiding group protection plans due to the lack of profitable underwriting. The report added that this stance&nbsp;was because group term insurance continues&nbsp;to&nbsp;become a commoditised product, which requires fine pricing apart from effective mortality experience.  Group term insurance is a group insurance product for companies where the insurer pays for death of an individual within that group/company during the policy tenure.  Overall, when it comes to the protection business,&nbsp;HDFC Life has said it continues to view a long-term opportunity in the protection business in a calibrated manner, with strong medium- to long-term prospects of this business in India.  &amp;quot;It expects around 15-20 percent growth in the business, given a calibrated approach and strong underwriting in place,&amp;quot; an Emkay Research report said.","Business, Companies, HDFC Life, insurance","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/m-saraswathy-6837/', 'name': 'M Saraswathy'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/hdfc-life-insurance-to-stay-awaygroup-term-business_15318661.html

In India, the oil and gas sector is among the core industries that are directly linked with economic growth and the overall sector is projected to grow at a faster pace, making it quite lucrative for investment.  India holds the third place on the global podium when it comes to oil and energy consumption, behind the US and China. India has also emerged as an oil refining hub and plans to increase refining capacity to 400 million metric tonnes per annum by 2025 from almost 249 MMTPA at the current level.  About 67 percent of the country&rsquo;s refining production is controlled by three giant conglomerates &ndash; Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Reliance Industries. Production and consumption of petroleum products has increased steadily in India over the decades, a trend that&rsquo;s expected to continue.  The Indian government recently decided to invest about Rs 7.5 lakh crore on oil and gas infrastructure in the next five years, followed by an allocation of $1.7 billion for liquefied petroleum gas and almost $147 million as feedstock subsidy for Bharat Petroleum.  The oil &amp;amp;amp; gas industry is expected to attract investments of about $25 billion in exploration and production by 2022, according to a report by India Brand Equity Foundation, a trust established by the Department of Commerce, indicating strong prospects for companies in the segment and a great investment opportunity for retail participants.  The leeway provided to foreign direct investment in oil exploration and infrastructure related to marketing of petroleum products and natural gas under the automatic route, followed by the enabling of 49 percent stake-holding in petroleum refining without any dilution of domestic equity in existing public sector undertakings under the same route has not only boosted liquidity in the segment but can also be seen as a major driver for the economy.  Demand in the sector is anticipated to grow at a faster pace as consumption of crude oil is expected to increase at a CAGR of 3.6 percent to 500 million tonnes by 2040 as India&rsquo;s oil demand is projected to advance at the fastest pace in the world to 10 million barrels a day by 2030 from 5.05 million barrels a day in 2020. This clearly indicates the growth potential for oil exploration companies.  Discussions on disinvestment in Bharat Petroleum are on track amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the process is expected to be completed by September-end, as announced by the finance minister. Natural gas consumption is expected to increase at a CAGR of 4.18 percent by 2040, for which the natural gas grid is being expanded.  Oil &amp;amp;amp; Natural Gas Corporation is expected to grow at a faster pace. The government is even examining a proposal to reconsider the current administered pricing mechanism, which could be the main trigger for the company&rsquo;s growth.  Considering these developments and prospects, the oil &amp;amp;amp; gas sector looks lucrative even with major technological advances in sustainable energy options. Substitutes or alternatives can be arranged, developed or produced, but there is no replacement for the classic Black Gold. Retail investors must understand this chronology and include this sector in their portfolio to be future-ready.

935,2021-07-28 14:53:29+05:30,Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd.,DRREDDY,Explainer: Why Dr Reddy's stock is taking hit post Q1FY22 earnings?,"In last two trading days, the stock has fallen by 13 days. Shares of Dr Reddy's are trading at Rs 4707.50 down by 2.82 percent at 11.35 am on July 28.","Drug maker Dr Reddy's stock has been battered following the announcement of Q1FY22 results on July 27. In the last two trading days, the stock has fallen by 13 days. Shares of Dr Reddy's are trading at Rs 4707.50 down by 2.82 percent at 11.35 am on July 28.  So why Dr Reddy's shares have taken a beating, and what analysts are saying.  Earnings miss  Dr Reddy&rsquo;s Q1FY22 earnings missed street expectations. The CNBC-TV18 poll had estimated a net profit of Rs 700 crore on revenue of Rs 4,991.4 crore. EBITDA was expected at Rs 1,168.5 crore with a margin of 23.4 percent. But Dr Reddy's ended up with net profit of Rs 570.8 crore a YoY drop of 1.5 percent, revenues of operations grew YoY 11.4 Rs Rs 4,919.4. It was the drop in EBITDA margins that has been a cause of concern. The EBITDA margin narrowed by 560 bps to 20.7 percent from 26.3 percent, on a year-on-year basis. There are several reasons for drop in margins.  US generics which contributes about 37 percent of overall sales also critical for healthy margins is where Dr. Reddy&rsquo;s saw high price erosion with competition to some of its key products. The other concerns according to analysts are the deferment of offtake by Dr Reddy's customers in the Pharma Services and Active Ingredients (PSAI), reduced export benefit and higher inventory provisions for certain products.  The company says this isn't an unusual price erosion seen in North America business, and expects the monetisation of generic Vascepa and Ertapenem in the US will help the company with margin expansion. Vascepa is used in treating patients with high triglyceride levels.  Concern on bribery allegations  The other concern for investors is the receipt of the subpoena from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the production of documents regarding allegations related to improper payments to healthcare professionals in Ukraine and some other CIS countries.  Please read here on the Dr Reddy's announcement  &amp;quot;We await clarity on the further course of action post the receipt of a subpoena from SEC,&amp;quot; said Motilal Oswal in its research report.  To be sure, the fall out may not be immediate, as the allegations need to be proved in the court which might take more than a year. But if allegations are true, Dr Reddy's may have to pay penalties.  Sputnik commercialisation delays  Analysts the delay in the anticipated Sputnik V full fledged commercialisation from July due to delays in imports from Russia and local production coming on stream, could pose challenges to the company.  The company expects Sputnik V vaccine supplies from domestic manufacturers from September-October.

Export sales increased by 17.7 percent due to timing of exports to affiliates,&amp;quot; it added.  At the operating level, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased by 13.4 percent year-on-year to Rs 848 crore, but margin declined by 10 bps to 24.4 percent in Q2CY21, could be due to rising commodity prices across oils and packaging materials.  The profit was estimated at Rs 582 crore on revenue of Rs 3,565 crore and EBITDA was expected at Rs 887 crore with margin at 24.9 percent for the quarter, according to the average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.

Its Managing Director and CEO Umesh Revankar said the Q1 FY22 numbers cannot be compared with the same quarter of the previous year as there was a moratorium.  &amp;quot;Due to the second wave of COVID, gross Stage 3 assets (NPAs) increased. So we felt the need to make additional provisioning. We also feel that passenger vehicle segment is still undergoing challenges and hence, we provided for it,&amp;quot; Revankar said.  During the period, it made COVID provisioning of Rs 261.02 crore.  Net interest income (NII) for the quarter rose 14.38 per cent to Rs 2,107.45 crore from Rs 1,842.54 crore in the same period of the previous year.  Gross Stage 3 assets stood at 8.18 per cent from 7.98 per cent. Net Stage 3 assets were at 4.74 per cent as against 5.06 per cent in the year-ago period.  The collections for April, May and June stood at 92 per cent, 87 per cent and 94 per cent.  &amp;quot;We feel that July has been good so far and we expect momentum to be much better in August and September. We should be able to reduce our Stage 3 and Stage 3 levels and will show better results going forward,&amp;quot; Revankar said.

943,2021-08-02 08:58:54+05:30,HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd.,HDFCLIFE,"HDFC Life adopts calibrated approach on term policy sales, CEO says",HDFC Life CEO Vibha Padalkar said the private insurer is being cautious about non-disclosures and comorbidities to help price risk better.,"HDFC Life Insurance is taking a calibrated approach on issuing term policies to keep costs under control and price risk better and has provided adequately for a possible third wave of coronavirus infections in the months ahead.  &ldquo;We have done a couple of things here. One is that we continue to write business in customer profiles we are comfortable with,&rdquo; MD and CEO Vibha Padalkar said in an interaction with Moneycontrol. &ldquo;However, when you look at categories where medical tests are not possible, or say factors like comorbidities, then we will be cautious.&rdquo;  The private life insurer carries out stringent underwriting, including financial underwriting, which involves checking past data from the Insurance Information Bureau of India and seeking income proof for the purchase of additional term plans. Medical tests are conducted for term plans to gauge a customer&rsquo;s general health, which has been a challenge amid COVID-19.  &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do home visits for everybody because in some cases, we need them to come to go and get a medical test. What we are saying is that we will defer writing a policy until maybe we are a little bit out of the woods on the pandemic front,&rdquo; she added.  While the company is enthused about the opportunities, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it should throw caution to the wind.  &ldquo;We have to be convinced that the risk-reward is very much in the zone because you know, growing term is not difficult but it has to be a risk that we are comfortable taking. Overall, we are taking a calibrated approach,&rdquo; she said.  HDFC Life&rsquo;s standalone profit fell 33 percent to Rs 302 crore in the first quarter of FY22 from a year earlier after an increase in COVID-19-related provisions.  The individual annualised premium equivalent (APE) grew 22 percent to Rs 1,306 crore, while protection based on individual APE decreased 4 percent to Rs 108 crore. APE refers to all regular premiums and 10 percent of single premiums collected during a period.  The term business was 8 percent of the individual APE in the first quarter compared with 11 percent a year ago.  Is there a blanket ban on term policies?  Padalkar explained that underwriting is done on a case-to-case basis.  &ldquo;There is no blanket ban on term policies and there was never such a decision taken. Eventually, COVID-19 will became just another disease. All that we ask for is disclosure because not disclosing means that we don&rsquo;t know the risk and the underwriting becomes opaque. We need these details to price the risk better,&rdquo; she explained.  HDFC Life is looking into aspects like over-insurance and staying away from prospective customers with comorbidities, company executives said during a call with analysts. Due to the increase in COVID-19 claims, insurers hiked term insurance rates in 2020. Padalkar said no price rise is in the pipeline for 2021.  &ldquo;But we will, like with every product, we will continue to evaluate how the experiences pan out,&rdquo; she added.  Provisions for COVID-19  HDFC Life said on July 19 it had created an excess mortality reserve of Rs 700 crore for potential adverse mortality. This is over and above policy-level liabilities calculated based on applicable regulations and in addition to Rs 165 crore of provisions.  In Q1, the insurer paid over 70,000 COVID-19-related claims amounting to about Rs 950 crore (net of reinsurance).  Padalkar explained that the decision to increase provisions was taken after the pandemic situation deteriorated significantly in April and May 2021.  &ldquo;There was a sudden rise in the number of deaths. Typically, we&rsquo;re seeing a lag of about two months between the death and the claims intimation. Now, we are seeing a drop in new cases and deaths in India. But there is a fair bit of conservatism, which is why we have created the Rs 700 crore reserve,&rdquo; she said.  While the number of daily COVID-19 cases and deaths in India has declined from a peak in April-May, fears of a third wave in the months ahead loom large.  Read: HDFC Life Insurance to stay away from group term business  Third wave and impact  Padalkar explained that the company has provided adequately for a possible third wave and is monitoring the situation daily.  &ldquo;If the third wave is worse than the second wave, then we would have to further strengthen our reserves. But then, we&rsquo;re getting into the realm of the unknown. Nobody really knows how it is going to pan out,&rdquo; she added.  HDFC Life has built statistical models to monitor COVID-19 deaths, possible claims and the lag in intimation of claims. Padalkar said based on the model, the company is on track on the provisions.  Give the lag of about two months, claims for COVID-19 deaths in June should come in by August-end or mid-September.  &ldquo;So, by the time we close our quarter two (July-September) numbers, we should have a good sense as to what the claims are. This will also help us plan better,&rdquo; she added.  Agency-led growth  While the pandemic took the sector by surprise in the first quarter last year, Padalkar said the company is well prepared this year. Agents added in the first quarter should start getting productive by the third quarter, after some initial handholding.  &ldquo;The fact that we&rsquo;ve already got 6,500 new agents (in Q1) means that we are able to build on this momentum and we can spend some time on training and then giving them leads and help them in field sales,&rdquo; she said.  Unlike pre-COVID-19 times, Padalkar said physical interaction is not essential and customers are comfortable in purchasing products digitally.  Branch rationalisation and going &lsquo;phygital&rsquo;  HDFC Life had plans to go &lsquo;phygital&rsquo; in FY21, combining physical branches and digital sales/servicing. Padalkar said this strategy continues and cited the example of executive servicing a policy via video interaction.  &ldquo;We need to see if it is really worthwhile to have a large full-fledged branch where footfalls are low. It could be a hub-and-spoke model,&rdquo; she said.  The sizes of branches could come down, considering that customers are comfortable transacting remotely.  On annuity payments, HDFC Life has started allowing senior citizens to submit their documents from home.  &ldquo;One needs to log in to the application, blink a few times and a facial-recognition model based on AI will recognise whether it is the same person. It just takes two minutes and the senior citizens can get their annuity payments without stepping out of their home,&rdquo; said Padalkar.  Persistency improvements  HDFC Life&rsquo;s 61st month persistency &ndash; policies that are renewed after being in force for five years &ndash; stood at 53 percent in Q1, similar to the level a year earlier. The 61st month persistency rate has been a cause of concern for the life insurance sector.  For HDFC Life, contacting customers for policies sold five years earlier has been a challenge.  &ldquo;What we have started doing is reaching out to customers early so that you have a year before they are to complete their five years. So that has helped big time in terms of being able to, first of all, connect. Wherever we are able to connect, we are able to retain almost 60-70 percent of those customers,&rdquo; she added.  However, FY21 was an aberration because customers faced pay cuts and job losses. Disposable income was lower and that led to more policy lapses. To deal with this situation, Padalkar said HDFC Life is offering loans against these policies.  &ldquo;We are telling customers that you can take a loan against these policies (over the counter) at interest rates that are substantially cheaper than personal loans. If you have some temporary cashflow issue, then please don&rsquo;t surrender your policy but take a temporary loan,&rdquo; she said.","Business, Companies, HDFC Life","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/m-saraswathy-6837/', 'name': 'M Saraswathy'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/hdfc-life-adopts-calibrated-approachterm-policy-sales-ceo-says_15360501.html

","Tata Consumer Products Ltd (TCPL) on Tuesday reported a decline of 42.05 per cent in consolidated net profit to Rs 200.24 crore for the first quarter ended June 2021, on account of one-time exceptional gains in the previous year.  The company had registered a net profit of Rs 345.55 crore in the April-June quarter a year ago, said TCPL, earlier known as Tata Global Beverages Ltd, in a BSE filing.  However, its revenue from operations in April-June 2021 jumped 10.85 per cent to Rs 3,008.46 crore, compared with Rs 2,713.91 crore in the year-ago period.  &amp;quot;Group consolidated net profit is lower driven by lower PBT (profit before tax) and one-time exceptional gain in the previous year,&amp;quot; said TCPL in a post-earning statement.  The exceptional item for the corresponding quarter of the previous year represents a gain of Rs 84 crore on the conversion of a Joint Venture (NourishCo Beverages) into a subsidiary and costs relating to the business integration Rs 21 crore.  &amp;quot;Revenue from operations increased by 11 per cent as compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year, mainly driven by the growth of 28 per cent in India Beverages (including NourishCo) and 20 per cent in India Foods,&amp;quot; it said.  TCPL's total expenses stood at Rs 2,696.19 crore, a jump of 16.69 per cent as against Rs 2,310.44 crore a year ago.  TCPL Group CFO L Krishnakumar told PTI, &amp;quot;Despite the market disruption, we grew our India business... Overall, it is a strong double-digit growth in spite of lockdown and other implications.&amp;quot;  TCPL's profitability in India was lower because tea cost in the latter part of the year went up significantly and now, it has started to come down, he added.  &amp;quot;It is the impact of the higher tea cost, compared to the same period last year, which is distorting the profitability of India business,&amp;quot; he said.  Krishnakumar also said the non-branded business, which is Tata Coffee plantation, also did well in this quarter. &amp;quot;These three contributed to outstanding quarter.&amp;quot;  In the fourth quarter of 2019-20, TCPL's revenue from its 'India-beverages' segment was up 28.16 per cent to Rs 1,267.09 crore as against Rs 988.62 crore.  &amp;quot;For the quarter, the India packaged beverages business recorded a 24 per cent value growth and three per cent volume growth, impacted by disruption caused by the second wave of COVID-19,&amp;quot; it said.  While Its India food business jumped 19.62 per cent to Rs 704.67 crore, compared with Rs 589.06 crore in the corresponding period a year ago.  It registered a 17 per cent volume growth, despite a high base in the corresponding quarter.  Moreover, during the quarter, its e-commerce recorded &amp;quot;significant growth of 153 per cent y-o-y and contributed 7.3 per cent of domestic sales&amp;quot;, TCPL said.  However, TCPL's revenue from the 'international-beverages' segment was down 12.69 per cent to Rs 767.58 crore. It was Rs 879.22 crore a year ago.  &amp;quot;International business reported lower revenue as previous year benefitted from COVID-19-induced pantry stocking,&amp;quot; it added.  While updating over Soulfull brand of breakfast cereals and millet-based snacks acquisition, TCPL said integration has been completed. Its sales and distribution have been integrated with the Tata Consumer Products' system, enabling a scale-up in reach.  Moreover, Tata Starbucks recorded revenue growth of 371 per cent in Q1 on a depressed base of last year that was impacted by nationwide lockdown.  Despite this growth, the revenue for the quarter for Tata Starbucks, a 50:50 joint venture between Tata Consumer Products Ltd and Starbucks Corporation, was lower when indexed to the same period in FY20.  &amp;quot;While April and May this year were impacted by localised lockdowns, June saw a V-shaped recovery with a gradual easing of restrictions on store operations,&amp;quot; said TCPL.  During the quarter delivery contribution increased to 27 per cent, driven by several focused initiatives to offset the decline in dine in.

The commission directed the firm to cease and desist from indulging in such practices, which have been found to be in contravention of the provisions of the Competition Act, as per an order dated August 6.  The CCI said the company has &amp;quot;abused its dominant position in the relevant market of 'the market for the supply of VSF to spinners in India' by charging discriminatory prices to its customers, denying market access and imposing supplementary obligations upon its customers&amp;quot;.  In a regulatory filing dated August 9, Grasim Industries said &amp;quot;while the Company is yet to receive certified copy of the said order, it believes that on merits it has sufficient grounds for an appeal&amp;quot;.  The regulator did not impose any monetary penalty on the firm, considering that a fine of Rs 301.61 crore has already been imposed on it through an order passed in March 2020 with respect to substantially similar conduct.  Besides, the period of contravention in the instant case (2017-18) was in continuation of the period of contravention in the previous case (2012-2017) and thus partly overlapped.  The commission noted that Grasim Industries is the sole producer of viscose staple fibre (VSF) in the country and enjoys a position of dominance in the relevant market for its supply to spinners in India.  The only other source of VSF for spinners in the country was through import, which is not an economically viable alternative.  The relevant market considered by the CCI was &amp;quot;the market for the supply of VSF to spinners in India&amp;quot;.  The fair trade regulator noted that the conduct of Grasim Industries in seeking details of VSF consumed from the domestic spinners to provide discount is nothing but an attempt by a dominant undertaking to control the entire market in its favour by putting conditions, which not only put supplementary obligations upon small players but also interfere with their freedom of trade.  &amp;quot;The Commission is satisfied that by requiring the spinners to submit production details, OP has asserted its market power upon the small players and has acted in an abusive manner,&amp;quot; it said.  In the case of one of the informants, Grasim Industries withdrew all discounts/credit notes, making the supply of VSF costly for it, resulting in the VSF yarn manufactured by it becoming uncompetitive, the regulator noted.  The order came after three informants had levelled various allegations against the firm pertaining to abuse of dominant position by the company.  The commission had directed the director-general (DG) to conduct an investigation into the matter and submit a report.","Business, Competition Commission of India, Grasim Industries","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/grasim-industries-abused-its-dominant-position-cci_15423261.html

The nation&rsquo;s second largest oil refiner and fuel marketing company had a net profit of Rs 2,076.17 crore in April-June 2020-21, the company said in a regulatory filing.  The profit was lower as a sharp movement in oil prices &ndash; from USD 19-20 per barrel to USD 40 &ndash; in April-June quarter of 2020 led to a spike in marketing margins.  This year, the movement has been range-bound. Revenue from operations rose to Rs 89,687.12 crore in April-June this year from Rs 50,616.92 crore last year.  Revenue from operations rose to Rs 89,687.12 crore in April-June this year from Rs 50,616.92 crore last year.  With fuel demand rebounding on a pick-up in economic activity, BPCL refineries processed 6.84 million tonne of crude oil in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, up from 5.4 million tonne a year ago.  Refinery throughput was however lower than 8.39 million tonne of January-March, mainly because of the impact of the second wave of COVID-19 on fuel demand and economic activity.  BPCL sold 9.63 million tonne of petroleum products in first quarter, up from 7.53 million tonne in the year-ago period but lower than 11.17 million tonne in the preceding quarter.  The company earned USD 4.12 on turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel during April-June, up from a gross refining margin of USD 0.39 per barrel in first quarter last year.  BPCL had reported a record net profit of Rs 11.940.13 crore in January-March largely because of the sale of its stake in Numaliarh Refinery Ltd to a consortium led by Oil India.  That sale had given a one-income net income of Rs 6,992.95 crore, the filing showed.  The government is selling its entire 52.98 per cent stake in BPCL.  Tuhin Kanta Pandey, Secretary to the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), which is running the sale process, on Wednesday had said the government intends to complete the privatisation of BPCL this year.","Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd, BPCL, Business, Results","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/bpcl-q1-profit-down-27-to-rs-1502-crore_15425641.html

On the open interest front, the highest Call open interest addition is seen at 16,500 strike. On the Put side, good participation is seen at 16,000 strike. The broader range of the index may be 16,000-16,500.  RSI plotted on the weekly timeframe remains above the 50-mark and is drifting higher towards the overbought level, indicating that the bulls are attempting to take control of the trend.  We expect the bullish momentum to continue and take the prices higher towards 16,500 (50 percent extension level of the rise from 10,790-15,431, projected from the 14,151-mark).  If it manages to breach above 16,500, we might see it move higher towards 17,019 (61.8 percent extension level of the rise from 10,790-15,431, projected from the 14,151-mark).

The breakout level of Rs 1,266 (weekly low) will act as a red flag level, followed by Rs 1,085 (multiple touchpoint level and the breakout level).  If the stock breaches Rs 1,394 on the upside, we may see it head higher towards Rs 1,525. If it falls and stays below Rs 1,266, it can fall further till Rs 1,085.  HDFC | LTP: Rs 2,665.15 | Target price: Rs 2,990 | Stop loss: Rs 2,600 | Upside: 12%  Key resistance levels to watch out for are Rs 2,840-2,896 (38.2 percent extension level of the rise from Rs 1,623-2,896, projected from Rs 2,354 and previous swing high), followed by Rs 2,990 (50 percent extension level of the rise from Rs 1,623-2,896, projected from Rs 2,354).  The breakout level of Rs 2,600 (weekly low) will act as a red flag level, followed by Rs 2,516 (20-week SMA).  HDFC, on the medium-term charts, seems to be breaking out of a multi-month resistance level. This up move is backed by rising volume, indicating participation in the breakout.  If the stock breaches Rs 2,896 on the upside, we may see it head higher towards Rs 2,990. If it falls and sustains below the Rs 2,600-mark, we can see a further downfall till Rs 2,516.  Siemens | LTP: Rs 2,198.90 | Target price: Rs 2,564 | Stop loss: Rs 2,100 | Upside: 17%  Key resistance levels to watch out for are Rs 2,383 and Rs 2,564 (78.6 percent and 100 percent extension level of the rise from Rs 1,120-1,967, projected from Rs 1,717, respectively).  The Rs 2,100 (the previous week's high) level will act as a red flag level, followed by Rs 1,917 (recent swing low).  The technical indicators point the stock is moving higher towards Rs 2,383 and Rs 2,564 eventually.  If the stock falls and remains below Rs 2,100, we can see it further fall to Rs 1,917.

V R K Gupta, Chief Financial Officer, BPCL, said market regulator SEBI has not yet responded to an application made for exempting the new owner of BPCL from making an open offer to shareholders of Petronet and IGL.  BPCL holds 12.5 percent of the shareholding in India&rsquo;s largest liquefied natural gas importer, Petronet, and a 22.5 percent stake in city gas retailer, Indraprashta Gas Ltd (IGL).  It is a promoter of both the listed companies and holds board positions.  As per the legal position evaluated by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) &ndash; the department running the process for the sale of the government&rsquo;s entire 52.98 percent stake in BPCL &ndash; the acquirer of BPCL will have to make open offers to the minority shareholders of Petronet and IGL for the acquisition of 26 per cent stake.  To bail out the new owner of BPCL spending additional Rs 19,100 crore in open offers for firms where it will have no operation control, it was suggested that BPCL sell a part of its shareholding in the two firms and shed promoter status.  &amp;quot;There is no decision taken as on date but we are working with the Government of India to protect the interests of BPCL,&rdquo; VRK Gupta said at an investor call.  &amp;quot;No decision on this aspect as on date.&rdquo;  BPCL does not want to pare down its stake in either IGL or Petronet as it sees it as a value destruction proposition.  He said the company and the government are working with SEBI to see that the requirement of the open offer is avoided.  BPCL made a formal application seeking exemption from the open offer. SEBI, he said, has so far not responded.  &amp;quot;We are still working with the Government of India to protect the interest of BPCL.&rdquo;  SEBI, he said, has so far not responded.  Since BPCL is a promoter of the two companies and because there is a change in ownership of the promoter firm, an open offer is triggered under SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011.  The thinking in the government is that the open offers for Petronet and IGL may deter bidders who are mostly eyeing BPCL&rsquo;s oil refining assets and 22 percent share of the fuel marketing business it commands, sources said.  The government&rsquo;s 52.98 percent stake in BPCL is valued at about Rs 52,000 crore at the current share price.  The requirement for making an open offer for an additional 26 percent to minority shareholders of the company will cost an additional Rs 25,600 crore.  On top of it, an open offer for a 26 per cent stake in IGL would cost the acquirer an additional Rs 9,700 crore and a similar offer for Petronet would cost about Rs 9,400 crore.  To avoid an open offer, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is being pursued to give exemption as already done when ONGC acquired a government stake in HPCL.  But in the case of the ONGC-HPCL deal, the promoters of both the firms were the same i.e. the Government of India and there wasn&rsquo;t a change of ownership per se.  Gupta said a virtual data room has been opened for the qualified bidders to do due diligence on the company.  BPCL has answered some queries raised by the bidders and a few others are yet to be answered.  Mining-to-oil conglomerate Vedanta and private equity firms Apollo Global and I Squared Capital&rsquo;s arm Think Gas are in the race to buy the government&rsquo;s stake in BPCL.  The stake sale in India&rsquo;s second-largest fuel retailer is crucial to raise a record Rs 1.75 lakh crore from disinvestment proceeds in fiscal year 2021-22 (April 2021 to March 2022).  BPCL will give the buyer ownership of around 15.33 percent of India&rsquo;s oil refining capacity and 22 percent of the fuel marketing share.","Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd, BPCL, Business, Indraprashta Gas Ltd, Petronet LNG","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/no-decisionstake-salepetronet-igl-yet-bpcl_15434681.html

971,2021-08-13 15:15:55+05:30,Eicher Motors Ltd.,EICHERMOT,Eicher Motors lines up Rs 500 crore capex for FY22 but warns of chip shortages,"Though it has a strong order book, Eicher's Royal Enfield division will not be able to deliver bikes in time for the festive season because of the semiconductor shortage. Other automakers, including Mahindra &amp;amp; Mahindra, Renault, Nissan, Ford and a third-party manufacturer for Maruti Suzuki, have also been forced to cut production due to the chip shortage.","Eicher Motors, maker of Royal Enfield motorbikes as well as VE trucks and buses, has readied capital expenditure of a little over Rs 500 crore for FY22. But supply chain shortages, including a shortfall in semiconductors, are preventing the company from ramping up production, said Siddhartha Lal, Managing Director, Eicher Motors,  &ldquo;The demand situation looks promising. We will be growing our supply situation in October-November. Production will not be as much as we would have liked because of chip shortages, which will continue into the second half. But we will see an improvement in the next quarter,&rdquo; said Lal.  At around 44,000 units in July, Royal Enfield, the leisure bike brand, is operating at almost half its optimum output, which is at 80,000 units a month.  Launches delayed  The brand has been unable to increase production due to a chip shortage, which has also forced it to defer the launch of new products.  &ldquo;We had a capex of just over Rs 500 crore last year and we are looking to have a similar amount for this year. There are shortages and they are affecting our plans but it&rsquo;s not by a tremendous amount. We don&rsquo;t have any major issues. There may be a couple of months' delay in launches due to supply issues,&rdquo; Lal added.  The semiconductor shortage has made the auto industry cut down on production and even take unscheduled production holidays. Suzuki Motor Gujarat (third-party manufacturer for Maruti Suzuki), Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra, Renault, Nissan and Ford are some of the companies that were forced to shut production due to the chip shortage.  Pune-based Bajaj Auto has also lost production of the KTM range of bikes due to the semiconductor shortage.  Strong order book   Though he did not provide a specific number, Lal claimed that Royal Enfield is sitting on a &lsquo;very good&rsquo; order book but it will not be executed in time for the festival months.  &ldquo;We have an order book we can&rsquo;t fully execute for the festive season. This is pretty obvious to us now,&rdquo; Lal added.  Royal Enfield sells motorcycles under six brands &mdash; Bullet, Classic, Meteor 350, Himalayan, Continental GT and Interceptor 650 &mdash; in the domestic and global markets. The last new-model launch by the brand was the Meteor 350 in November 2020.  Lal added that Eicher Motors will have to relook at price hikes if raw material prices begin to inch up again. The company increased prices in July to negate the impact of the input cost rise. Raw material prices, however, have started to taper off, noted Eicher Motor executives.","Auto, Business, Royal Enfield, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/eicher-motors-linesrs-500-crore-capex-for-fy22warnschip-shortages_15434761.html

It holds the distinction of being India's first shore-based integrated steel plant.","Domestic steel giant Tata Steel is interested in acquiring state-owned Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), the company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Managing Director T V Narendran said.  RINL, under the Ministry of Steel, owns and operates a 7.3 million tonnes plant in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. It holds the distinction of being India's first shore-based integrated steel plant.  The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on January 27, gave its ''in-principle'' approval for 100 per cent disinvestment of government stake in RINL, also called Visakhapatnam Steel Plant or Vizag Steel, along with RINL's stake in its subsidiaries/joint ventures through strategic disinvestment by way of privatisation.  When asked about Tata Steel's interest in acquiring RINL, Narendran replied in affirmative.  &amp;quot;Yes! Also, because for inorganic growth for long product opportunities... There is a great opportunity because it is east as well as it is south, it is a coastal plant so there are many advantages...,&amp;quot; he told PTI.  RINL has approximately 22,000 acre of land and enjoys access to Gangavaram Port, where raw materials such as coking coal etc arrives.  Since RINL is located on the eastern coast of India, the acquisition will give Tata Steel more access to the South East Asian markets -- where the company already has presence -- besides catering to the domestic needs of special steel through rail and road.  The CEO further said Tata Steel has submitted Expression of Interest (EoI) for Odisha-based steel maker Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd (NINL) as well. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NINL is a joint venture company, in which four central PSUs -- MMTC, National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC), Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) and MECON -- and two Odisha government companies IPICOL and Odisha Mining Corporation (OMC) are shareholders.  In January 2020, the Centre gave an in-principle approval for strategic sale of NINL by allowing the six PSU shareholders to sell their stake in the steel company.  The EOI has been submitted by Tata Steel Long Products Ltd, he said. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Narendran said, &amp;quot;we have done the due diligence, we are participating in the process. I think we have some time to put in our bids etc. So, we will take a call, when we need to decide. We have submitted the EoI but not as Tata steel but as Tata Steel Long Products.  Kolkata-based Tata Steel Long Products is in the business of manufacturing high alloy steel, primarily for the auto sector and wire rope industry. With one million tonne capacity, it is one of the largest specialty steel plants in India in the long product segment.","Business, Companies, T V Narendran, Tata Steel, Vizag","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/tata-steel-interestedacquiring-vizag-based-rinl-ceo-t-v-narendran_15449281.html

The 43 onland fields have been clustered into 11 contract areas that will be bid out to companies offering the highest oil and gas output on top of a pre-decided baseline, the company said in a statement.  ONGC had in June 2019 invited similar bids for 64 fields that were clustered into 17 contract areas. The bid round did not evoke much interest and failed.  &amp;quot;ONGC announces Notice Inviting Offer (NIO) seeking partners for enhancement of production from its marginal nomination fields in line with its goal of maximizing recovery from its producing fields,&amp;quot; the statement said.  The fields on offer have a total in-place oil and oil equivalent gas volume of about 160 million tonne.  &amp;quot;These contract areas are spread across the states of Gujarat, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh,&amp;quot; it said.  The 64 fields offered in 2019 held a cumulative 300 million tonne of oil and oil equivalent natural gas reserves.  The oil ministry has been unhappy with the near stagnant oil and gas production and believes giving out the discovered fields to private firms would help raise output as they can bring in technology and capital.  It has been tasked by the Prime Minister to cut dependence on oil imports by 10 per cent by 2022 from the over 77 per cent dependence in 2014-15. But the dependence has only increased and is now over 83 per cent.  &amp;quot;Eligible companies (Indian or foreign), either alone or in consortium with other companies, may bid for one or more contract areas,&amp;quot; the statement said adding the bidders are required to fulfill the requisite technical and financial criteria.  The last date for bidding is December 3.  A pre-bid conference will be held on October 20, 2021.  &amp;quot;Bidders interested in studying the data can purchase field information docket and data packages. Upon request, the interested companies shall be able to access the data viewing facility at IRS, Ahmedabad and visit the fields, if required,&amp;quot; it said.  ONGC said operators will have complete marketing and pricing freedom to sell hydrocarbons on an arm's length basis through competitive bidding.  &amp;quot;Partner will be selected on a revenue-sharing basis. The revenue will be shared on incremental production over and above the baseline production under business-as-usual (BAU) scenario,&amp;quot; it said.  The contract period will be for 15 years with an option to extend by 5 years.  &amp;quot;A reduction of 10 per cent in the royalty rate for incremental production of natural gas over and above BAU scenario&amp;quot; will be offered, it said.  Continuous exploration is permitted during the contract period including the right to explore all kinds of hydrocarbon.  Also, no past investment/ expenditure incurred by ONGC is to be shared or paid by the contractor.  While ease of entry/ exit will be provided, an incentive will also be given to enhance production beyond committed incremental production, ONGC added.","Business, Companies, ONGC","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/ongc-seeks-partners-to-raise-output43-oil-gas-fields_15459521.html

Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor Company and even Royal Enfield have shared plans which include multi-crore investments for products, factories, charging infrastructure and an enabling eco-system for electric vehicles.  HMSI, which is the country&rsquo;s second largest two-wheeler maker with popular products under brands such as Activa, Shine and Unicorn, has not announced any EV plans thus far prompting Honda&rsquo;s dealers to raise questions.  Atsushi Ogata, President, Managing Director and CEO, HMSI said, &ldquo;I am under pressure because during my market visits our dealers ask me what the EV strategy of Honda is. Please allow me to give my reply not today. But I will find out different opportunity to communicate with the media in future.&rdquo;  Companies like Hero Electric, Bharat Forge and start-ups like Ather Energy and Ola Electric are pumping in investments to not only add new electric two-wheelers but raise manufacturing capacity in the hope to entice customers to give up petrol-powered two-wheelers and switch to battery-powered electric vehicles instead.  Ogata was taking questions from the press on the sidelines of launching the CB200X, an adventure tourer motorcycle priced at Rs 1.44 lakh (ex-showroom, Gurugram). The bike only has the Hero XPulse to compete against in its segment. The launch comes weeks before the start of the festive period but amid the worst supply chain crisis witnessed by the automotive industry.  &ldquo;We may have some effect of the semiconductor shortage due to the pandemic on some specific models. The festival season is the most important period for us and we are trying to communicate to some specific suppliers to avoid a negative impact on sales. We are also trying to communicate with our customers waiting for our product to avoid any negative impact,&rdquo; Ogata added.  In line with its rivals, HMSI too has increased the prices of its models due to the sustained increase in raw material costs like steel and precious metals. The company however is trying to reduce the cost burden to be passed on to the consumer which otherwise would hurt demand.  &ldquo;Cost of some raw materials have drastically increased since the beginning of this year. We are forced to revise our price quarter by quarter. But fortunately, the raw material prices are stabilizing because of demand recovery. We are trying to reduce the price burden on the customer as much as possible including our effort to reduce the price through our suppliers,&rdquo; Ogata added.  Senior officials of HMSI further added that there has been sustained pick-up in interest for Honda products which is giving it the confidence for the festive season.  &ldquo;The market feedback we are receiving and the market data in terms of enquiry footfalls, website and social media traffic indicate that sales momentum will continue up to festivals,&rdquo; said Y S Guleria, Director, HMSI.  To further expand its reach in the market HMSI will add 1,000 consumer touch points within three years which will take its total to 7,000 touch points.","Auto, Business, Honda, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/honda-motorcyclescooter-india-anxious-over-electric-vehicle-mania_15459881.html
977,2021-08-19 18:12:29+05:30,Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.,SUNPHARMA,Pharma rides on Covid second wave in Q1; US generics remain a concern,"Companies expect sales in the Covid-19 portfolio to moderate in the second quarter even as sales of drugs in other categories increase. In the US generic drugs market, it could be another weak quarter","  Pharmaceuticals have long been considered a defensive sector for investors during times of uncertainty, especially during a pandemic like Covid-19. The sector did live up to those expectations.   During the first quarter of FY22, which coincided with the second wave of the pandemic in India, sales of domestic formulations soared as people stocked up on medicines. The low base of the first quarter of FY21 also amplified year-on-year growth. The S&amp;amp;amp;P BSE Healthcare index gained 22 percent since April 1, 2021, twice as much as the benchmark Sensex, which rose 11 percent.  Domestic formulations make-up for slowing US generics business &ldquo;Aggregate earnings of pharma companies under our coverage in 1QFY22 were in line with our&nbsp;estimates. Aggregate sales were up 15 percent YoY to Rs 540 billion (estimate Rs 530 billion),&rdquo; brokerage firm Motilal Oswal said in its recent review report of Q1 results. EBITDA grew 9 percent YoY to Rs 128 billion (estimate Rs 124 billion), the brokerage added.  Motilal Oswal attributed the higher-than-estimated numbers to strong growth in domestic formulation sales, led by heightened demand for Covid-19 treatment drugs and a low base a year earlier.   Aggregate other expenses, as a percentage of sales, rose 40 basis points YoY to 22.6 percent, while employee costs declined 130 basis YoY to 17.7 percent in the first quarter of FY22.  The numbers would have been better had it not been for lower sales of generic drugs in the US. Indian companies saw a high single-digit price erosion in the US generic drug market, coupled with continued weak demand for the acute portfolio of products during the quarter.  India Ratings and Research&nbsp;noted that the high incidence of price erosion was led by manufacturers/distributors looking to liquidate large inventories due to Covid-19-led uncertainties, fewer abbreviated new drug application approvals that led companies to bid aggressively on existing products, and aggressive pricing by small players to gain market share.  Sun Pharmaceutical Industries,&nbsp;Cipla,&nbsp;Divi&rsquo;s Laboratories,&nbsp;Gland Pharma,&nbsp;Alkem Laboratories,&nbsp;Ipca Laboratories&nbsp;and&nbsp;Granules India&nbsp;are some of the companies that did well in the first quarter.  What to expect in the second quarter With the pandemic easing across India, except in a few states, companies expect sales in the Covid-19 portfolio to moderate in the second quarter even as sales of non-Covid-19 drugs increase.  &ldquo;In Q2FY22, there will be moderation. Remember, we have grown on a low base. This level of growth is unsustainable,&rdquo; Kedar Upadhye, Cipla&rsquo;s global chief financial officer, said in a recent interview to Moneycontrol. &ldquo;Our attempt would be to continue the momentum.

The company fell short of the 75 percent vote share required for Lal&rsquo;s re-appointment and remuneration. Around 26.95 percent of the shareholders voted against this Special Resolution during an annual general meeting (AGM) on August 17.  &ldquo;The Eicher Motors board has been informed and we are considering the quick next steps,&rdquo; the company said on August 20. Since Lal continues to be the director and CEO, there were no changes in the way Eicher Motors is governed and operates, it said.  Lal&rsquo;s reappointment proposal was voted down by the shareholders over a 10 percent hike in salary proposed amid the COVID-19 pandemic when the revenues and profits have been slow, a report in The Economic Times said.  The re-appointment proposal was combined with a 10 percent hike in Lal&rsquo;s salary, which most public institutional&nbsp;shareholders rejected&nbsp;at the company&rsquo;s 39th Annual General Meeting (AGM) on August 17, even as the average employee&rsquo;s salary had increased by only 1 percent, the report cited sources as saying.  Lal, however, got 86.18 percent votes for his re-appointment as director, allowing him to continue as the director and CEO of Eicher Motors, the maker of Royal Enfield bikes and trucks and buses under VE Commercial Vehicles.  The board would meet soon to revise the terms of the resolution for Lal&rsquo;s appointment.  &ldquo;They will have to present (the resolution) to shareholders again with revised terms. The &lsquo;vote against&rsquo; is mainly against the remuneration,&rdquo; said a senior member of a proxy advisory company that advises shareholders on corporate matters.  Lal&rsquo;s remuneration for FY21 was Rs 21.12 crore, which included salary, perquisites and commission, a 9.97 percent hike from FY20. No sitting fees were paid nor any stock options given to Lal during FY21, Eicher Motors said.  Hit by the coronavirus pandemic, the company&rsquo;s net consolidated profit for FY21 stood at Rs 1,347, the lowest since FY16. During the same period, Lal&rsquo;s remuneration more than doubled from Rs 9.51 crore in FY16.  Following uncertain business conditions, shareholders in recent years have shot down hikes for Tata Motors&nbsp;directors Guenter Butschek, Ravindra Pisharody and Satish Borwankar.  Butschek, the former managing director of Tata Motors, saw opposition from the shareholders twice during his five-year tenure.  In 2018 Neeraj Kanwar, Vice Chairman and Managing Director of&nbsp;Apollo Tyres&nbsp;took a 30 percent cut in salary following strong objections from institutional and private investors over a 42 percent&nbsp;increase in his pay package.  Whole-time Director and CEO of Royal Enfield Vinod Dasari, who left the company a few days ago, drew a salary of Rs 25.33 crore for FY21.","Auto, Business, Eicher Motors, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/eicher-motors-board-to-meet-soon-to-revise-md-siddhartha-lal39s-appointment-resolution_15462461.html

They have contended that were not aware about Sebi Act, PIT regulations and the company's code of conduct for prevention of insider trading.  The orders came after Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) received a letter from Titan, wherein the company intimated the regulator about contravention of insider trading norms and company's code of conduct for prevention of insider trading by some of its designated persons/ employees.

The index is closely trading above its 21-day exponential moving average on the daily interval. Maximum Call open interest (OI) is seen at 16,800 strike which will be a crucial level for this expiry.  On the downside, massive OI addition is visible at 16,500-16,600 strikes.  For the last couple of trading sessions, market breadth&nbsp;has been in the favour of the bulls.  In terms of ratio, for every two positive closings, there is one negative closing.  We have also spotted a bullish hidden divergence in the RSI (14) wherein prices did not register a new intermediate low but the RSI (Relative Strength Index) formed a new low near 65-level on the daily interval.  The immediate support for the Nifty is placed near 16,400 level and resistance is pegged near 16,900 level.  Bank Nifty has made multiple attempts to break the resistance levels placed at 36,300&ndash;36,400 levels. But it has been unable to breach the upper band of the horizontal trendline on a daily scale.  The immediate support for the Bank Nifty is placed near 34,600 and resistance is pegged near 36,300.  Here are two buy calls for the next 2-3 weeks:  HDFC Bank | LTP: Rs 1,555.25 | Target price: Rs 1,650 | Stop loss: Rs 1,510 | Upside: 6%  This stock has been trading in a symmetrical triangle formation for the last four months and has formed a trendline resistance at Rs 1,530.  It broke out of a symmetrical triangle pattern at Rs 1,558 on August 24 and registered a decisive breakout that suggests a change in the trend from sideways to upside.  It is trading above its 21, 50 and 100- day exponential moving averages on the daily timeframe, which is positive for the near term.  The MACD indicator is reading above its centerline with a positive crossover above its signal line.  Momentum oscillator RSI (14) is reading above 60 level which indicates positive momentum may continue going ahead.  Aurobindo Pharma | LTP: Rs 695.55 | Target price: Rs 760 | Stop loss: Rs 665 | Upside: 9%  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Momentum oscillator RSI (14) has reached near extremely oversold level (10) and a sharp bounce back from the current level cannot be ruled out.  Volume activity has increased significantly in the last few trading sessions which indicates accumulation in the oversold conditions.

995,2021-08-26 14:30:37+05:30,Hero MotoCorp Ltd.,HEROMOTOCO,Amitabh Kant warns automakers against the rise of start-ups in the EV space,"EV disruption is led by start-ups and they could capture a significant market of the EV space, said CEO of Niti Aayog.","A sharp rise in the number of electric vehicles (EV) start-ups registered in India over the past few years is threatening to disrupt the traditional business model of large established players if they refuse to switch to EV mobility soon, warned Amitabh Kant, CEO of Niti Aayog.  Kant, who was speaking at the 61st&nbsp;Annual Session of the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association (ACMA) added that the EV disruption is led by start-ups and they could capture a significant market of the EV space.  &ldquo;The domestic manufacturers of vehicles must realise that we are in the midst of one of the biggest transitions that are going to take place. EV will become inevitable whether you like it or not. And therefore, the Indian manufacturers must read the writing on the wall and capture the lead of disruptive changes,&rdquo; Kant said in his address.  A number of privately funded start-ups have sprung up over the last 4-5 years in the two and three-wheeler electric vehicle segment. Start-ups like Ola Electric, Ampere Vehicles, Euler Motors, Okinawa, Ather Energy to name a few have already launched EVs in the market.  On the other hand, established players like Hero MotoCorp, Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India, Suzuki, Royal Enfield, Mahindra Two Wheelers, and Yamaha are yet to launch their electric two-wheelers. Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Company who have launched electric two-wheelers are yet to launch electric three-wheelers.  &ldquo;It is important for me to say this. The number of start-ups registered for EV is exponentially growing. If established players do not move towards EVs you will see start-ups disrupting all of you and move forward; capturing a very large segment of the market. Therefore, the challenge for established players to become the drivers of this disruption,&rdquo; Kant added.  While some established companies are yet to roll out their first EV, start-ups have set up mega factories that can churn out an EV every 2 seconds. The Rs 2,400 crore Ola Electric factory has a peak capacity to produce 10 million two-wheelers a year. Ather has set up a new factory having a capacity of 100,000 units annually. Hero Electric, the country&rsquo;s largest electric two-wheeler maker, is planning to expand its capacity to 1 million units.  To be sure, Hero MotoCorp will launch its first electric vehicle in the March quarter of FY22. Bajaj Auto and TVS are also keen to launch more EVs in the near future.","Auto, Business, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/amitabh-kant-warns-automakers-againstrisestart-upsthe-ev-space_15486481.html

Billionaire Anil Agarwal's Vedanta group as well as two US funds -- Apollo Global and I Squared Capital - had last year submitted initial bids to buyout the government's entire 52.98 per cent stake in India's third-biggest oil refiner and second-largest fuel retailer.  Detailing the ''Next Step'', the ''Brief Note on BPCL Disinvestment'' said Transaction Advisor and Asset Valuer are to submit an inception report, bidders have to complete due diligence of the company and sale purchase agreement has to be finalised.  Also, &amp;quot;security clearance&amp;quot; of bidders may be needed &amp;quot;since consortiums are being formed&amp;quot;, it said without giving details.  The bidding process allows for other interested parties to join and form a consortium with any one of the bidders which had submitted an expression of interest (EoI).  Firms run by Indian billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani as well as global oil majors such as Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Exxon did not submit an EoI for acquiring BPCL at the close of the deadline on November 16, 2020.  However, several top oil producers from the Middle East and Russia's Rosneft were said to be interested in BPCL which would give the buyer access to over 14 per cent of India's oil refining capacity and 23 per cent fuel market share. But they hadn't submitted any bids.  Industry sources said it was possible that one of the global oil majors or a Middle East oil producer may be teaming up with the investment funds already in race.  Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd and Adani group are &amp;quot;extremely unlikely&amp;quot; to join the race, a source said.  Steel magnate Lakshmi N Mittal, who runs an oil refinery in Punjab in joint venture with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd, was considered a potential candidate but sources said he was not interested in BPCL whose acquisition will cost nearly Rs 80,000 crore at current market trading price.  The document showed financial bids will be called after submission of asset valuation report and business valuation report by Asset Valuer and Transaction Advisor respectively.  Reserve price will be fixed thereafter and price bids will be opened after that.  If its bid is accepted, the bidder quoting the highest price will be called to executive share purchase agreement and make payment.  Open offers required under the extant guidelines/approvals shall follow, it said.  BPCL owns 35.30 million tonnes of oil refining capacity spread over three refineries at Mumbai, Kochi in Kerala and Bina in Madhya Pradesh. It has 18,768 petrol pumps and 6,169 LPG distributors.","BPCL, Business, Companies, oil","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/global-oil-majors-may-be-joining-race-for-bpcl_15486581.html

MIEL is the first private company in India to manufacture oil and gas extraction rigs with indigenous technology, a company statement said.  An oil rig is a structure with equipment for drilling an oil well.  Outfitted with advanced hydraulic technology, the second rig is set to begin operations at an oil well near GGS-IV oil field near Kalol in Gujarat, under ONGC Ahmedabad Asset. By March 2022, 23 rigs will be delivered to ONGC. The aim is to hand over all the 47 rigs at the earliest, the company said.  &amp;quot;MEIL is also planning to expand its overall business to up to USD 2 billion in coming days by manufacturing indigenous rigs.

The oil rigs manufactured by MEIL with advanced hydraulic technology dig oil wells faster and operates with minimal power. With a capacity of 1,500 HP, the rig can easily drill up to 4,000 metres. The rig is expected to be operational for 40 years and comes with the most modern technology, even in terms of security standards.  P Rajesh Reddy, Vice-President, MEIL, said India is importing 80 per cent oil products. Reducing dependence on energy imports is a must for the success of Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat. MEIL is proud to be contributing to both the initiatives and playing its part in boosting domestic oil production and securing the country&rsquo;s energy future.  The indigenous component level in the advanced rigs is 50 per cent at present, and will be increased to 90 per cent over time, he added.  &amp;quot;Until recently, India was mostly dependent on oil and fuel extraction rig imports, but MEIL has significantly boosted domestic rig manufacturing capacity. The second rig handed over to ONGC is manufactured with state-of-the-art hydraulic and automated technology. ONGC will benefit from these advanced rigs built with cutting-edge technology,&amp;quot; N Krishna Kumar, Head-Oil Rigs Division, MEIL said.  MEIL will manufacture and deliver the rigs to ONGC Assets in Assam (Shib Sagar, Jorhat), Andhra Pradesh (Rajahmundry), Gujarat (Ahmedabad, Ankleshwar, Mehsana and Cambay), Tripura (Agartala) and Tamil Nadu (Karaikal).  ONGC's order of 47 rigs comprises 20 workover rigs and 27 land drilling rigs. The 20 workover rigs include 12 with a capacity of 50 MT, four of 100 MT capacity, and another four with 150 MT capacity.  MEIL further said the rigs can operate at -65 degrees also.

The amount will be spent mainly towards completion of the expansion of the Kalinganagar plant, and expansion of mining operations and recycling business, he told PTI replying to a question related to Tata Steel's plans for India business in the financial year 2022.  This is in addition to the Rs 3,000 crore the company will spend on its European operations to make the business strong, sustainable and enhance product mix.  &amp;quot;Our capex will be broadly Rs 8,000 crore for India. We stand by that guidance.  &amp;quot;A lot of it will be going towards Kalinganagar expansion. We will also be spending on our raw material because we continue to expand our iron ore mining capabilities to support the Kalainganagar expansion. So, in raw material and Kalinganagar...we will cover this Rs 8,000 crore,&amp;quot; Narendran said.  Tata Steel is in the process to expand the capacity of its plant in Kalinganagar, Odisha, by five million tonne per annum (MTPA) to eight MTPA.  Recently, the CEO informed that Tata Steel has outlaid a capital expenditure of Rs 3,000 crore for its operations in Europe.  When asked if Tata Steel will explore markets to set up recycling plants and part of the Rs 8,000-crore capex will be utilised for the same, he said the company follows a different business model in scrap.  It is in partnership, he added.  &amp;quot;Whatever we need to spend, it will be part of that; but we also have a different model operating in scrap. There are partners dealing to set up the facilities. They will set up, we will manage the quality and sell the steel. It will be a partnership model,&amp;quot; he said.  Narendran also said Tata Steel is looking at western and southern regions as more scrap is available there.  &amp;quot;We have to set up these facilities where more scrap is available. The work is being done by the team,&amp;quot; he said.  On August 18, Tata Steel announced commissioning its first steel recycling plant in Rohtak, Haryana.

The index continues to be in an uptrend so one should continue to trade with a positive bias and avoid taking any contra trades until any reversal is seen.  The only concern that we have been highlighting is the banking index which has been underperforming for so long.  This index is still in a consolidation phase and has not breached its important supports. Hence, there is a good probability of some buying interest emerging in this sector which would then result in further support to the benchmark.  The immediate supports for Nifty are placed around 16,600 and 16,500 while the levels to watch on the upside will be 16,800 and then 17,000.  One should keep track of the global developments and also book timely profits in trading positions.  Here are two buy calls for the next 2-3 weeks:  Cipla | LTP: Rs 922 | Target price: Rs 960 | Stop loss: Rs 902 | Upside: 4%  Some stocks from the pharmaceutical space have undergone a corrective phase in the last couple of months and this stock, too, has corrected from its recent highs.  However, the medium-term chart indicates that the trend still continues to be bullish.  The price structure has turned positive and the RSI oscillator has given a positive crossover and is indicating positive momentum.  BPCL | LTP: Rs 471.15 | Target price: Rs 496 | Stop loss: Rs 456 | Upside: 5%  This stock has been consolidating within a range of Rs 469 - Rs 440 for the last couple of months.  This entire consolidation was around its 89-day exponential moving average support and now there are signs of a breakout from this consolidation on the higher side.  The Bollinger Bands, which had narrowed recently, have started to widen and prices are riding the upper end of the band which is a positive sign.

The Banking index also gained some momentum and closed at its multi-week high of 36,424.60.  The market is likely to move towards 17,250-17,300, tracking strong global cues.  Technical charts suggest that the banking index may outperform in the coming sessions as Bank Nifty has managed to close above the key resistance level of 36,400.  The bias is likely to remain in favour of bulls as long as Nifty is holding above 17,000 level.  Derivatives data suggests bears are now feeling uncomfortable at the current juncture as Call writers were observed unwinding their positions while Put writers were seen shifting to higher bands and added hefty open interest at 16,900 and 17,000 strikes.  Here are three buy calls for the next 2-3 weeks:  Shriram Transport Finance Company | LTP: Rs 1,347.45 | Target price: Rs 1,490 | Stop loss: Rs 1,230 | Upside: 11%  For the last two months, this stock has been moving in a downward-sloping rising channel on daily and weekly charts.  It has been maintaining its downtrend with the formation of lower highs and lower bottom patterns.  At the current juncture, this stock has taken support at its 200-day exponential moving average on the daily charts and given a V-shape recovery, regaining momentum above Rs 1,300.  Additionally, it has given a breakout above the falling trendline of the channel. Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 1,330-1,355 for the upside target of Rs 1,490.  Canara Bank | LTP: Rs 158.65 | Target price: Rs 177 | Stop loss: Rs 147 | Upside: 12%  For almost the last ten weeks, this stock has been hovering in a broader range of Rs 145-165, holding well above its 200-day exponential moving average on the daily charts.  This week, this stock has given a breakout above the rectangle pattern after a prolonged consolidation.  The price-volume action is also well supported for the next up leg in the prices. Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 158-159 for the upside target of Rs 177.  Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company | LTP: Rs 552.30 | Target price: Rs 622 | Stop loss: Rs 500 | Upside: 13%  This stock has formed a double bottom pattern on the daily charts around Rs 470 level and given a sharp recovery in a short span of time.  On the broader charts, it has given a breakout above the falling trendline of the downward sloping channel.  Rising volume with rising price suggests a long build-up in the stock as secondary oscillators hint at positive divergences on the short-term charts.  Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 545-555 for the upside target of Rs 622.

Furthermore, the company would issue 87m shares to Exide Industries Limited towards the balance amount at INR685 per share. HDFC Life expects to secure all the approvals and complete the transaction by 30th Jun'22. In FY21, Exide Life earned a total premium of INR33.25b (8.6% that of HDFC Life), and total AUM stood at INR187.8b (10.4% that of HDFC Life). The acquisition would enable HDFC Life to increase its market share by ~140bp to 16.5% (15.1% for FY21) as per the total new business APE. This would make HDFC Life the second largest life insurer, while IPRU remains a close third, with market share of 15.7% for FY21. HDFC Life's market share among private players on an Individual APE basis would improve ~130bp to 16.8%, thus narrowing the gap with private sector leader SBI Life. The acquisition would enable HDFC Life to strengthen its agency channel as Exide Life has a total agent count of ~37k, nearly 34% that of HDFC Life. Exide Life has a strong foothold in southern India, especially in Tier 2 and 3 locations. This complements the overall geographical presence of HDFC Life. The transaction values Exide Life at 2.5x Jun'21 reported EV, which appears expensive in the context of Exide life's three-year premium and EV CAGR of ~10% and 8%, respectively.  Outlook However, given the total size of the transaction, our view on the company does not change. Our EV per share estimates on HDFC Life is likely to increase by 2.5%/~2% over FY22/FY23E as the transaction is completed. Maintain Neutral.

In our view, Exide&rsquo;s acquisition has minimal compliments to HDFCLI given a smaller size, it has been losing market share and immediate margins &amp;amp;amp; opex synergies are on lower side which will be have to be worked upon, compared to 2.5x multiple to current EV.

HDFC Life will issue ~87mn new shares at ~Rs685/share to Exide Industries and will pay Rs7.26bn in cash. After the deal completion, HDFC Ltd. will hold a 47.9% stake in the resultant entity and Exide Industries will hold 4.1%. In terms of most key metrics, the size of Exide Life is ~10% of HDFC Life (Exhibit 1).  At ~2.5x Jun&rsquo;21 EV, the valuation paid for Exide Life far exceeds the quality of franchise: The Indian life insurance market has been difficult for smaller players, and the players below the Top-8 have been struggling for many years. In particular, the smaller players without any meaningful bancassurance distribution have been battling to grow and manage their high fixed costs. Exide Life has been no different. It has been struggling on the expense front and its retail business has recorded poor persistency. In this context, the ~2.5x P/EV (Jun&rsquo;21) paid to Exide Life appears to be at a significant premium over its intrinsic value. The three listed peers of HDFC Life currently trade at ~3.5x Jun&rsquo;21 EV. It is worth noting here that these listed peers have a very strong brand, massive economies of scale, formidable bancassurance distribution and sustained high operating return EV.  Outlook The valuation premium of ~Rs40bn over the EV of Exide Life means ~3% of HDFC Life's current market cap. However, the valuation of ~2.5x P/EV for a franchise without any material banca distribution sets an expectation benchmark for other such struggling companies.

The group is set to cross Rs 1,000 crore in exports and international revenue this financial year, backed by strong global demand for bicycles, e-bikes and automotive components segments, which would be as much as 92 per cent higher over FY21, HMC Group said in a release.  Earlier this year, the group announced its plans to set up a new international headquarters, Hero International (HIT), in London as part of a push towards expanding Hero Cycles overseas business and strengthening its global presence.  Besides Hero Cycles Ltd, the group also includes auto parts manufacturing companies Hero Motors Ltd, ZF Hero Chassis Systems and Munjal Kiriu Industries, among others.

1027,2021-09-16 15:01:40+05:30,Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd.,DRREDDY,Sputnik Light single-dose vaccine launch in India may get delayed,An expert panel of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation asks company to conduct Phase-3 immune-bridging clinical trials on Indian population. Dr Reddy's spokesperson declines to say when the trial will start.,"The launch of Sputnik Light single-dose vaccine by Dr Reddy's&nbsp;in India may take some more time as the company will have to conduct Phase-3 immune-bridging clinical trials on the Indian population.  The Subject Expert Committee (SEC) under the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has approved the company proposal to conduct the trials.  Sputnik Light is the first dose of Sputnik V vaccine, which uses the human adenovirus ad26 vector. A Dr Reddy's spokesperson declined to say when the trial will start.  The SEC asked Dr Reddy's to assess the primary endpoint at days 42, 90 and 180 and do an interim analysis at day 42 as this data was not generated during Sputnik V trial in India after the first dose, as this data was not generated during the Sputnik V trial in India after the first dose, as its duration was for 21 days.  The minutes of the 172 SEC meeting, which was held on August 8, said that Dr Reddy's presented the updated safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data of the Phase 3 clinical trial of Sputnik Light vaccine conducted in Russia, along with the proposal to conduct it in India.  Dr Reddy's has conducted the Phase 3 bridging trial of Sputnik V vaccine, and has received approval for its restricted emergency use in India.  The company holds the sole distribution rights for the first 250 million doses of the vaccine in India, as per its agreement with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF).  Is it a U turn?  In June, Dr Reddy's submitted a proposal for the grant of marketing authorisation of Sputnik Light, along with the interim safety and efficacy data generated from Phase 1/2 clinical trials in Russia and presented the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol before the committee.  The committee, after deliberation, asked Dr Reddy's to present the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data of the Phase 3 trial that is being carried out in Russia for considering the authorisation in the country.  The safety and immunogenicity data of component-1 in the Indian population has already been generated in the country in another trial. There seems to (be) inadequate data and justification in conducting a separate similar trial,&rdquo; the SEC said.  After detailed deliberation, the committee recommended that the firm should present the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data of the Phase 3 clinical trial of Sputnik Light that is being carried out in Russia for considering the proposal for the grant of MA in the country,&rdquo; it said.  An official at a clinical research firm, who didn't want to be named, said that the SEC was clarifying its position as the data was not generated for up to 42 days during the Sputnik V trial in India.  But the previous SEC statement did lead to ambiguity, which should have been avoided,&rdquo; he said.","Business, Companies, coronavirus","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/viswanath-pilla-6848/', 'name': 'Viswanath Pilla'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/sputnik-light-single-dose-vaccine-launchindia-may-get-delayed_15537381.html

The Delhi-based company has opted for two ordinary resolutions this time &mdash; reappointment of Lal as MD for five years and approval of his remuneration &mdash; instead of presenting a combined special resolution, as was done previously. That resolution, proposed before shareholders on August 17, failed to get the requisite number of votes at Eicher Motors&rsquo; 39th annual general meeting.  Pay grouse  While the root cause of shareholder resentment was Lal&rsquo;s Rs 21.12 crore pay package for FY21, his reappointment as MD of the company also got stuck due to the proposals being combined. Lal was reappointed as MD on August 23 by the Eicher Motors board for a period of five years starting May 1, 2021.  The nomination and remuneration committee of Eicher Motors has tweaked Lal&rsquo;s pay package. As per the revised structure, his fixed pay, including allowances, now stands revised at Rs 12 crore per annum as against his FY21 salary of Rs 7.38 crore.  UK perks  Perquisites now have a maximum limit of Rs 1 crore per annum, as against Rs 7.04 crore last year. Lal has been operating out of the UK since 2015.  As per the details provided by Eicher Motors, Lal gets a fully furnished residence and reimbursement of utilities, two company-provided and maintained cars, reimbursement of hospitalisation expenses and insurance premium for self and family, leave travel reimbursement as well as club membership for self and family. Eicher Motors has not provided any estimate of such expenses.  Lal&rsquo;s pay package also includes statutory contributions in accordance with UK laws and payment of commission subject to a maximum limit of 80 percent of fixed pay (Rs 9.6 crore). The commission paid shall be subject to the recommendations of the NomRem Committee and subsequent approval by the board, the company clarified. While Eicher Motors did not provide an estimate on the statutory and commission packages, Lal had received a commission of Rs 6.70 crore in FY21.  Revised package  After his reappointment as the MD on August 23, Eicher Motors announced a revision of Lal&rsquo;s total pay package. The company clarified that his overall remuneration, including fixed pay, perquisites, other benefits and commission, shall not exceed 1.5 percent of the net profits of the company in any particular financial year as computed in the manner referred to in Section 198 of the Companies Act, 2013. The previous cap was 3 percent.  The actual remuneration during FY21 was at 1.04 percent of profits, and it was at a lower percentage in the preceding years, Eicher Motors clarified.","Auto, Business, Eicher Motors, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/siddhartha-lalâs-pay-eicher-motors-approaches-shareholders-again_15568081.html

In Q1, slippages were elevated amid wave-2 of COVID-19. However, KMB&rsquo;s COVID-related provisions (0.6% of loans) and restructuring was low at 0.25% during the quarter. In Q2, we expect slippages to decline as collection efficiency improves. Consequently, GNPA ratio is expected to be at ~3.3% in Q2, down from 3.56% in Q1. NII is also likely to grow by ~15% with better recoveries and an increase in credit growth during the quarter.

","Grasim Industries Ltd on Friday said the income tax department has raised a demand of Rs 8,334 crore on the company as capital gains tax with regard to sale of shares in a group firm.  The Aditya Birla Group firm added that it would take &amp;quot;appropriate action&amp;quot; against the tax demand.  Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax (DCIT) has raised a demand for the assessment year 2018-19, Grasim Industries said in a regulatory filing.  This is related to the scheme of Grasim Industries' merger with Aditya Birla Nuvo and Aditya Birla Financial Services.  The company said it would &amp;quot;take appropriate action against the said Order which it believes is against the spirit of tax laws.&amp;quot;  Earlier, the DCIT had sought dividend distribution tax for the same deal in 2019, which was stayed by the Bombay High Court.  DCIT has likewise imposed a capital gain tax on the value of shares, without considering that the shares were issued to the shareholders pursuant to the scheme of arrangement and no consideration was received by the company which could be subjected to tax, Grasim Industries noted.  &amp;quot;As a corollary to the earlier order, the DCIT has valued the shares issued by the Resulting Company (Aditya Birla Capital Limited) at Rs 24,037 Crore as the sale consideration for transfer of undertaking and has made the addition of capital gains of Rs 22,772 Crore to the income of the Company as part of scrutiny assessment for the AY 2018-19 and has passed draft assessment order on 30th September 2021.  &amp;quot;Based on the draft Order, demand for the AY 2018-19 is estimated at Rs 8,334 Crore, including interest and excluding any penalty proceedings,&amp;quot; the filing said.

The source stated that besides listing of the three firms, the plan to meet its divestment target of Rs 1,5000 crore also includes sale of its stake in NTPC-SAIL Power Company Ltd (NSPCL), which is expected this fiscal year.  The NSPCL is a joint venture company of NTPC and SAIL (50:50 equity) was incorporated on February 8, 1999. It was formed to own and operate captive power plants for SAIL's steel manufacturing facilities located at Durgapur, Rourkela and Bhilai.  According to the source, the Rs 15,000 crore divestment plan is as per agreed targets of performance set by the company with the Ministry of Power which includes listing of NTPC Renewable Energy Ltd (NTPC REL), North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd (NEEPCO) and NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd (NVVNL) by March 2024.  The source said that the listing of NTPC REL is expected by October next year. NTPC REL, a 100 per cent subsidiary of NTPC Ltd, currently has a renewable project portfolio of 3,450 MW of which 820 MW projects are under construction and 2,630 MW projects have been won for which PPAs (power purchase agreements) are pending to be executed.  NTPC had incorporated NTPC REL with the Registrar of Companies, NCT of Delhi &amp;amp;amp; Haryana on October 7, 2020, to undertake renewable energy business.  The listing of NTPC REL assumes significance in view of the ambitious plan of the company to have 60GW of renewable energy capacity by 2032. The RE installed capacity of the firm would be 45 per cent of the 130 GW envisaged by 2032.  Earlier, the company had planned to have a minimum of 32 gigawatt (GW) capacity through renewable energy (RE) sources constituting nearly 25 per cent of its overall power generation capacity by 2032.  The present installed capacity of NTPC Group is 66,900 MW (including 13,425 MW through JVs/Subsidiaries) comprising of 47 NTPC stations (23 coal-based stations, 7 gas-based stations, 1 hydro station, 1 small hydro, 14 solar PV and 1 wind-based station) and 26 joint venture stations (9 coal based, 4 gas based, 8 hydro, 1 small hydro 2 wind and 2 solar PV).  The source said the equity component of the NTPC REL would be around Rs 50,000 crore and rest of the requirement would be met through long-term loans, debentures, bonds and other such modes.  The plan to have 60 GW RE capacity by 2032 would entail an investment of Rs 2.5 lakh crore.  The other arm which the company wants to list is NEEPCO, in which it had acquired 100 per cent equity stake held by the Government of India (GoI) on March 27, 2020, making it a wholly owned subsidiary.  NTPC had acquired NEEPCO for Rs 4,000 crore. Another arm which would be listed on the bourses is the NVVN, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of NTPC.  It was incorporated on November 1, 2002 for carrying out the business of purchase and sale of all forms of electrical power, both conventional and non-conventional, venturing into RE, E-Mobility and Hydrogen Mobility.","Business, Companies, divestment, NEEPCO, North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Limited (NEEPCO), NTPC, REL","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/ntpc-chalks-out-rs-15000-crore-divestment-plan-to-list-arms-ntpc-rel-neepco-nvvnl_15589641.html

According to Emkay Global, Infosys is expected to report 5.6 percent QoQ USD revenue growth in Q2FY22 after factoring in 60bps cross-currency headwinds. &amp;quot;EBIT margin may fall by 158bps QoQ due to salary hikes, supply-side challenges, high subcontracting costs, and Daimler deal transition costs,&amp;quot; said the brokerage which sees flat profit at Rs 5,193.8 crore on revenue of Rs 29,554.1 crore (that can grow by 5.9 percent QoQ).  Key monitorables would be FY22 guidance where the brokerage expects Infosys to raise its revenue growth guidance to 15-17 percent n constant currency terms YoY from 14-16 percent and to retain its EBITM guidance of 22-24 percent, and 2) large deals intake.

However, corporate growth has moderated to 6% yoy/0.5% qoq. HDFCB retained a relatively higher housing portfolio of Rs71.3bn from HDFC Ltd (Rs30.6bn in Q2Y21; Rs55bn in Q1FY22). Adjusted for portfolio buyouts too, overall credit growth was 15% yoy/4% qoq. We believe that the acceleration in retail credit could be mainly contributed by VF, cards and housing portfolios. In a media interview, HDFCB's group head for commercial &amp;amp;amp; rural banking had indicated better disbursements in transportation financing (CV/CE) during Jul-Aug'21. Deposit growth was healthy at 14% yoy/4% qoq, while CASA deposit growth was stronger at 29% yoy - a phenomenon likely to be seen across large banks, partly benefiting from the RBI's directive to maintain current accounts with the main lender only. The CASA ratio remains high and healthy at 47%, leading to better CoF. This, coupled with acceleration in retail loans, should lead to better margins qoq, which dipped to a low of 4.1% in Q1.

A P/BV ratio of 1.5x for thermal projects gives valuation of ~Rs. 133,000 crore (close to current market capitalisation) and indicates negligible value for large renewable energy (RE) expansion plans.

1047,2021-10-05 14:39:54+05:30,Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd.,ONGC,"Gas price increase positive for ONGC, Reliance Industries: Fitch","The price for gas from fields that were assigned by the state to oil companies, mainly Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL), increased to USD 2.90 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) for October 2021-March 2022, from USD 1.79 per mmBtu in the previous six months.","The 62 percent increase in natural gas prices by the Indian government will boost the profitability of upstream companies in the country and support their investment spending, Fitch Ratings said on Tuesday.  The price for gas from fields that were assigned by the state to oil companies, mainly Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL), increased to USD 2.90 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) for October 2021-March 2022, from USD 1.79 per mmBtu in the previous six months.  &amp;quot;Higher gas prices will increase the input cost for key end-consumer sectors, to the extent the price hike is passed on,&amp;quot; Fitch said.  Domestically produced gas is supplied on a priority basis to certain sectors, with 30 percent of it being consumed by power producers, around 27 percent by the fertiliser sector and 19 percent by city gas distributors in FY21.  The gas price increase will hit the fertiliser sector's profitability by increasing working-capital requirements, Fitch said.  Auto gas fuel's price will remain competitive against liquid fuels, albeit with a reduced differential, notwithstanding the gas price increase. This is because liquid auto fuel prices have also been climbing in recent months, given the rise in crude oil prices.  The cost of power generated by gas-based power plants will increase, which will further decrease their utilisation.  &amp;quot;ONGC's and OIL's ratings and standalone credit profiles (SCP) remain unchanged as the price increase was largely in line with Fitch's expectations, driven by the rise in global prices over July 2020-June 2021,&amp;quot; the rating agency said in a statement.  However, sustained high gas prices will strengthen ONGC's &amp;quot;bbb+&amp;quot; SCP and will add buffer to OIL's credit metrics, which will support its capex to expand capacity at subsidiary Numaligarh Refinery Ltd.  The government also increased the price ceiling for gas produced from deepwater and other difficult fields to USD 6.13 per mmBtu from USD 3.62 per mmBtu.  &amp;quot;Reliance Industries Ltd's gas production from KG basin will benefit from the higher price ceiling, but the impact on RIL's financial profile is minimal as gas makes a limited contribution to its revenue,&amp;quot; Fitch said.  The rating agency estimated ONGC's net leverage, measured by net debt/EBITDA, to improve to around 2.1x in the financial year ending March 2022 (FY22) from 2.7x in FY21 as upstream earnings recover and downstream earnings stay resilient.  Natural gas' share of consolidated revenues is in the mid-single digits for ONGC, given its integrated business model.  It expects OIL's FY22 leverage to be 1.9x. Natural gas accounted for about 13 percent of OIL's upstream revenue in FY21, Fitch said.  Disclaimer: MoneyControl is a part of the Network18 group.

1052,2021-10-07 20:36:52+05:30,Infosys Ltd.,INFY,Q2 preview: Earnings growth likely to be skewed,"Although overall earnings growth is expected to be strong, analysts expect it to be driven by a handful of sectors.","As the Q2 earnings season starts tomorrow with TCS setting the ball rolling, market experts expect an overall healthy earnings growth of about 32-35%. But a majority of the growth is expected to come from the banking, metals, and exports of IT services and chemicals. Leave aside these high growth sectors, earnings growth for the rest of the pack is likely to be in the range of 10-12%, analyst consensus estimates for Q2 suggest.  Mood is upbeat about the growth in banking, metals, and exports. IT services sector is expected to grow the most (expected over 20%) on the back of an uptick in spending by clients for transformation and cloud adoption, a ramp-up of large deals, and release of pent-up demand.  As per the report from Kotak Institutional Equities, Infosys is expected to raise FY2022E revenue growth guidance to 16.5-17.5% from 14-16% earlier, and HCL Tech is expected to clock 12% revenue growth.  Momentum in demand for chemicals in the export market is expected to continue. Though the industry is witnessing logistical challenges affected by container availability and a sharp rise in freight cost, demand environment will remain robust. The demand from autos, agrochemicals, pharma, foods, and cosmetics remains solid.  As per the report from Edelweiss, Aarti Industries (sales growth 30% YoY) and PI Industries (37% YoY) are likely to witness solid revenue growth on the back of capacity additions and acquisition, respectively. SRF&rsquo;s technical textiles and packaging films businesses continue to boost profitability on the back of higher commodity prices.  Banking sector is not expected to show any big negatives on the asset quality and restructuring of loans, there will be a decline in slippages and provisions. Large banks are expected to perform better because of growth in the disbursement of loans, improved net interest margin, and core fee income.  Commodity/Metals are expected to witness a sharp growth in realisations and volume on a YOY basis. Edelweiss' report suggests that the domestic steel demand is showing signs of recovery, prices in the secondary market (ferrous) are up and non-ferrous prices continue to stay robust.  But, the high coal prices can lead to cost escalation. The current power crunch in China will keep the prices on a strong footing which should benefit companies like Tata Steel, Hindalco, SAIL, Vedanta, and Jindal Steel.  Kotak Institutional Securities expects a strong performance from retailing on the back of strong volume growth led by an increase in footfalls post normalisation and operating leverage led margin expansion. Revenue for Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail, Avenue Supermarts, Trent, and Titan are expected to clock robust performances.  The tide seems to have turned down for sectors such as durables, cement, FMCG, and Telecom. Edelweiss expects these sectors to post less than 10% growth at the PAT level due to higher margin pressure.  Auto companies are likely to post a weak quarter due to production issues related to a shortage of chips and higher metal prices. Margins are expected to contract significantly for auto companies.  The capital goods segment is expected to have a moderate quarter on the back of strong execution and availability of manpower compared to last year. Most of the durables and electrical companies are expected to register double-digit revenue growth. However, supply chain bottlenecks could result in some loss of revenue for electrical companies.  YES Securities expects leading capital goods brands to continue to see market share gains led by better distribution reach in both direct sales and e-commerce channels and better product availability in the current environment.  Pharmaceutical earnings are expected to grow at a modest 5% as domestic revenues of many companies will see erosion post COVID. However, acute therapies are witnessing smart recovery and a slew of good launches in US will help report good numbers.  The real estate sector is expected to show strong performance in the second quarter after a weak first quarter. The mood is buoyant because both the residential demand and new launches that were postponed in the last quarter will play a positive role this quarter. Both the residential sales and new launches this quarter have doubled compared to last year. According to the consulting firm Anarock, the top seven cities tracked by the firm have clocked 62,800 units of pre-sales and witnessed 64,560 launches in Q2FY22. Sops given by several state governments on stamp duty augured well for the pent-up demand in the residential segment.  Re-opening of malls post the second wave of COVID will likely see an earnings recovery for retail portfolio in 2QFY22 that will have a positive impact on earnings of DLF, Brigade, Oberoi, and Prestige. DLF and Sobha are top picks for Edelweiss while YES Securities backs Prestige, Sunteck, Oberoi Realty and DLF.  Cement demand started on a strong note in July 2021 benefiting from pent-up demand but got severely hit in September 2021 due to monsoons. Kotak Institutional Securities estimate a 5-7% YOY industry demand growth in 2QFY22. Demand from government infrastructure projects offset weakness in trade demand. Pan-India cement prices at the retail level declined (-2% QoQ, +3% YoY) in 2QFY22 due to seasonality.  Variable costs for cement companies should increase in 2QFY22 led by higher energy and freight costs. Energy costs would increase by 5-6% QOQ as per Kotak, led by higher pet coke prices. Freight costs should also increase by 3-4% with a 3% QOQ increase in diesel prices. They estimate EBITDA/ton to decline by Rs300/ton, 21% QoQ on lower prices coupled with higher variable costs. Edelweiss expects the industry needs to take sharp and sustainable price hikes to pass on the cost impact.  Consensus is for the earnings momentum to continue in the ensuing quarters but will be more skewed in favor of banks, commodities, and exports (IT &amp;amp;amp; Chemicals).  Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities says, &ldquo;as the economy picks up and we witness sharp drop in the COVID-19 cases, stability in industrial indicators and ramping up of vaccination coverage, corporate earnings are estimated to improve. Rising exports and increased GST collections also hint at better performance going forward.&rdquo; He feels that the earnings upgrades could be limited to sectors such as Metals, Oil &amp;amp;amp; gas, Cement, Capital Goods, IT, and Infrastructure.

The profit growth on YoY basis was after the adjustment for provision for legal claim reported by the company in September 2020 quarter. The reported profit growth was 28.7 percent YoY.  Its consolidated revenue during the July-September period stood at Rs&nbsp;46,867 crore, up 16.8 percent over a year-ago quarter, with double-digit growth across business verticals, led by ramp-up in order books, recovery in India business and increase in digital spends by corporates.

1062,2021-10-09 13:44:26+05:30,Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.,TCS,TCS Q2 results: Key highlights from the company&rsquo;s earnings concall,Management guided that demand environment is strong and is sustainable over the medium term.,"Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on October 8 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 9,624 crore for the quarter ended September 2021 (Q2FY22), registering a 14.1 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth, driven by broad-based demand and resilient margins.  The profit was also driven by other income that increased 21.6 percent YoY (up 54.1 percent QoQ).  The profit growth on a YoY basis was after the adjustment for provision for legal claim reported by the company in September 2020 quarter. The reported profit growth was 28.7 percent YoY.  Its consolidated revenue during the July-September period stood at Rs 46,867 crore, up 16.8 percent over a year-ago quarter, with double-digit growth across business verticals, led by ramp-up in order books, recovery in India business and increase in digital spending by corporates.  The revenue growth in constant currency came in at 15.5 percent YoY.  Here are the highlights from TCS' Q1 FY22 earnings call as compiled by Narnolia Financial Advisors:  The 2QFY22 was a strong quarter with all the industry verticals growing at mid-teens or more driven by increase outsourcing, investment in building digital core, and growth and transformation.  The company&rsquo;s revenue grew by 4% QoQ and 15.5% YoY in CC terms, 3.2% QoQ and 16.8% YoY in Rupee term to Rs 46867 crore and 2.9% QoQ and 16.8% YoY in dollar terms to USD 6.333 billion.  The BFSI segment grew by 17% YoY in CC terms and crossed USD 2 billion quarterly revenue run rate.  Good acceleration was visible in communication and media which grew by 15.6% YoY and Technology and Services grew 14.8% YoY in CC terms.  Supply-side shortage and increase in employee churn had led to higher back filing expense and greater use of subcontractors across the industry.  Currency was not favorable in the quarter as the US dollar appreciated and all other currencies depreciated against rupee creating margin a headwind.  EBIT Margin expanded by 10 bps QoQ to 25.6% despite the headwinds due to disciplined aggregation.  The order book for the quarter was healthy with a TCV of USD 7.6 billion distributed across verticals and geographies.  BFSI segment deal wins stood at TCV of USD 2.1 billion, the retail segment with USD 1.2 billion and North America with USD 3.9 billion TCV.  During the quarter there was robust client addition in every revenue bucket.  Management guided that the demand environment is strong and is sustainable over the medium term.  Management guided that margins were maintained in the quarter despite the supply-side issue but not certain for coming quarters.","Results- Brokerage Conference Call, Tata Consultancy Services","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/news18-7519/', 'name': 'News18'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/resultsbrokerage-conference-call/tcs-q2-results-key-highlights-fromcompanyâs-earnings-concall_15612041.html

TCS posted consolidated revenue during the July-September period at Rs 46,867 crore, up 16.8 percent over a year-ago quarter.  The revenue growth in constant currency came in at 15.5 percent YoY.  However, the numbers were largely below the street estimates. A CNBC-TV18 poll of analysts had estimated profit at Rs 9,731 crore on revenue of Rs 47,466 crore for the quarter under review.  At the operating level, EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) margin at 25.60 percent for the September 2021 quarter also missed CNBC-TV18 poll estimates of 26.05 percent. Margin grew by 0.1 percent sequentially, but declined 0.6 percent YoY.  Also Read - Santosh Meena of Swastika expects correction in TCS stock price post earnings, but Tata Motors still looks attractive  Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after Q2FY22 results:  Motilal Oswal  Given TCS&rsquo; size, capabilities, and portfolio stretch, it is rightly positioned to leverage expected industry growth.  The company has consistently maintained its market leadership and shown best in-class execution. This gives the company continued room to maintain its industry-leading margin and demonstrate industry-leading return ratios.  Motilal Oswal remains positive on the company, given its strong growth outlook. But high valuations leave limited room for disappointment.  A miss on estimates in 2QFY22, coupled with a soft margin outlook, can result in near term pressure on the stock.  The target price of Rs 3,770 per share implies 31x FY23E EPS and maintained neutral rating.  Sharekhan  The broking house broadly maintained the estimates for FY2023 and FY2024 because of strong broad-based demand, resilient operating performance, strong deal wins and healthy deal pipeline.  It believes TCS is well positioned to capture growth and transformation opportunities given its competencies across technologies and verticals, strong contextual knowledge, excellent product and platform portfolio and solid execution capabilities.  It expects the company&rsquo;s US Dollar revenue and earnings to clock an 11/14&nbsp;percent CAGR over FY2022-24E.  Any correction in stock price would provide a good investment opportunity for long-term investors. Hence, maintain a buy rating on TCS with a revised price target of Rs 4,400.  IDBI Capital  The research firm fine-tunes its forecast and raises the EBIT margin by 30bps/20bps to 25.8/25.9&nbsp;percent resulting in an increase in EPS by 2.6/5.1&nbsp;percent to Rs 106/121 for FY22E/FY23E.  It recommends holding with a target price of Rs 4,072 (versus Rs 3,498) based on PER of 32x FY23E.  Emkay  Broking house cut FY22/23/24 EPS estimates by 1.2/0.3/0.3&nbsp;percent after factoring in the Q2 performance miss.  The operating performance miss for the second consecutive quarter and rich valuations will weigh on stock performance.  The research house maintained a hold with a target price of Rs 3,700 (28x Sep'23E EPS).  KRChoksey  It expects strong deal momentum across verticals, ease in travel restrictions and continued investments in newer technologies such as product &amp;amp;amp; platform which will help maintain the growth momentum in the medium term future.  It is assigning a P/E multiple of 32x to the FY24 estimated EPS of Rs 135 to arrive at a target price of Rs 4,256 per share (earlier target of Rs 4,053), an upside of 8&nbsp;percent over the CMP. Accordingly,&nbsp;it&nbsp;reiterates an accumulate rating to the stock.  HDFC Securities  TCS continues to witness strength in its core business segment and has bagged higher mid-sized deals spread across verticals.  The ongoing supply side crunch (attrition increased to 11.9&nbsp;percent, yet industry-best) and return of discretionary spend will limit margin expansion despite operating leverage and higher pricing.  Our target price of Rs 4,180 is based on 32x Dec-23E EPS with EPS CAGR of 14&nbsp;percent over FY21-24E. Maintain Add rating.  Prabhudas Lilladher  It&nbsp;believes TCS&rsquo; low attrition (as compared to peers) is a competitive advantage in the current environment where growth is constrained more by supply rather than demand.  TCS&rsquo; well managed supply side engine is an ace in the current battle for talent. It believes that leaders have a far broader set of capabilities and they end up addressing a larger portion of the IT spending pool, which helps them to grow at a solid rate on a high base.  It&nbsp;projects revenue growth of 16/13.7&nbsp;percent dollar terms for FY22/23E respectively. We arrive at a DCF based target price of Rs 4,113 (earlier: Rs 3,968).

Ramstahn Ghunchihai limestone mine, which has reserves of 209.77 million tonnes, was auctioned in the current fiscal.  The limestone mine is among five mineral blocks that have been successfully put for sale in 2021-22, according to the mines ministry.  Sree Jayajothi Cements Pvt Ltd has emerged as preferred bidder for another limestone block in Andhra Pradesh.  Three companies, Patel Kaushik Kumar, Karan Polabhai Gojiya and Ramsi Meramanbhai Barad, bagged one bauxite mine each in Gujarat, according to the mines ministry.  Of the 13 mineral blocks auctioned in the last fiscal, nine were limestone mines, two were gold mines and one was iron ore block. Forty-three mineral blocks were put for sale in FY20, 19 mines in 2018-19, 14 in 2017-18, 15 blocks in 2016-17 and six block in 2015-16.  The government had earlier said that it was planning to bring some changes in the mining sector.  This was in line with the government's announcement that the sector would witness reforms and a flurry of activities in the current year.  Mines Minister Pralhad Joshi also called for more participation from people into exploration and mining. The minister also asked states to go for fast decision-making and bring the mineral blocks to early auction.  With time, the frequency of major discoveries of an economically viable mineral deposit has decreased and this is a worldwide phenomenon despite tremendous technological advancements.  Hence, the situation warrants an out-of-box thinking, new approaches, enhanced cooperation and enthusiastic participation from the government and the private sector, the government had said.  The MMDR Amendment Act, 2015, ushered in transparency in the allocation of mineral concessions in terms of prospecting licence and mining lease. In this continuous endeavour, the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act was further liberalised in March 2021.","Business, Companies, limestone block, Madhya Pradesh, UltraTech","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/ultratech-emerges-as-preferred-bidder-for-limestone-blockmadhya-pradesh_15614021.html

The company, however, continues to be focused on the 26-28 percent operating profit margin band and has its structures aligned towards achieving the aspirational band, its chief financial officer Samir Seksaria underlined.  &amp;quot;(as we see) short-term volatilities, it is not that we will do things only to protect the margins. Whatever the investments are required, whatever is the right thing to do we will continue to invest. In the short term, we are not looking at&hellip; the short-term focus will be to feed the needs of the business as far as possible,&amp;quot; Seksaria told PTI.  In the September quarter, the largest software exporter reported margins at 25.6 percent and stated the possibility of short-term volatilities on this front like supply-side constraints as the attrition goes up, currency headwinds and the possibility of demand getting impacted due to future waves of pandemic.  The company, which employs over 5 lakh people, also reported an increase in attrition at 11.9 percent.  &amp;quot;Currently, the short-term volatility is in terms of supply-side challenges mainly due to elevated attritions,&amp;quot; Seksaria said, adding that in the quarter gone by, it also faced headwinds from currency,&amp;quot; he said.  TCS has been able to manage better than peers on the supply side or human resources front because of its upfront investments even when demand had shown difficulties in the initial days of the pandemic, he added.  The same is seen in the 75,000 new hires done in the last one year, or over 43,000 hires in the first half of the ongoing FY22, he said.  The CFO said the company learnt from its experience of the global financial crisis of 2008, and expected demand to recover in a V-shape.  However, despite strong hiring, it was able to get employee costs down by 0.20 percent to 56.3 percent as it shifted tactics to hire more low-cost freshers, he said, making it clear that the company will continue to balance between freshers and laterals going forward.  &amp;quot;Our investments going forward are more in terms of competency building, strengthening research and innovation and intellectual property,&amp;quot; he said.  Seksaria said the company had realigned investments between the three as per business demands and the overall investments were at the same levels.  He said there has not been any material impact on the costs because of the pandemic, even though there have been a few changes in some items.  From a deal flow perspective, the company continues to be positive, adding that the new deal signing has always ranged between USD 7-9 billion.  The company has invested Rs 1,250 crore in the first half of the fiscal for physical infrastructure and will continue with similar activities, he said, adding that in FY21 it had invested Rs 3,000 crore.","Business, CFO, Companies, investment, Tata Consultancy Services, TCS","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/tcs-to-continue-investments-as-per-business-requirements-cfo-samir-seksaria_15616201.html

Most of the National Thermal Power Corporation(NTPC) plants are running at 55 percent capacity as their coal stocks are enough for one-two days, he claimed.  Delhi purchases most of its power from NTPC but supply has been halved, Jain told reporters.  &amp;quot;NTPC which supplies us 4000 MW power has reduced it to half currently. This has led us to generation of power through gas that costs Rs 17.25 per unit,&amp;quot; he said.  Delhi has three gas-based plants with a total capacity of 1900 MW, he said.  &amp;quot;The Centre has terminated the quota of cheap gas. We have to purchase it and the generation cost is Rs 17.50 which is not sustainable. Also, we have to resort to spot purchase of power due to the crisis at a high rate of Rs 20 per unit,&amp;quot; said the Power minister.  Jain said the Centre should accept that coal crisis and address it instead of getting in denial mode.  Chief ministers of many states including Yogi Adityanath of Uttar Pradesh have written to the prime minister on the issue.  Punjab is also facing power cuts, Jain added.  Several states have warned of a power outage in the wake of a severe coal shortage, but the coal ministry has asserted that sufficient dry fuel is available in the country to meet the demand of electricity generating plants and has dismissed as &amp;quot;entirely misplaced&amp;quot; any fear of disruption in power supply.","Business, coal, Companies, Current Affairs, India, NTPC, power, Power Minister, Satyendar Jain","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/ntpc-has-halved-power-supply-to-delhi-power-minister-satyendar-jain_15617021.html

Available in seater and sleeper configuration, the fully built buses are the first products to debut after the takeover of the Volvo bus division by VECV in August 2020.  The custom-developed buses, designed and built in Volvo Buses India factory in Hosakote, Karnataka, are based on the front engine Eicher 6016 R LPO 12.4 m chassis. Priced upwards of Rs 40 lakh, these buses are positioned below the Volvo buses which typically come at more than Rs 1 crore.  &ldquo;This is the first milestone in our drive to offer a complete range of market-adapted economy, mid-premium and premium buses across all market segments. We are confident that the fully factory-built coach and sleeper will prove viable alternatives to rail and air travel,&rdquo;&nbsp;Akash Passey, President&nbsp;of the Bus Division&nbsp;at VECV, said.  These airconditioned buses that can accommodate 43 passengers are powered by a 5.1-litre VEDX5 diesel engine derived from Volvo Group&rsquo;s global powertrain family. It is capable of delivering a maximum power of 210 HP and a flat torque of 825 Nm @ 1200-1600 rpm.  The sleeper version offers 30 berths and space for luggage. The berths are separated by full-height partitions. The seater variant gets pushback seats and LED ambience, USB ports, reading lights, speakers, AC louvers and infotainment systems.  VECV claims to have sold the new buses to a few customers in Bengaluru. Senior officials of the company are confident of passengers' return to the bus segment who have been shying away due to concerns over Covid-19. The launch also coincides with the start of the festive season followed by the peak holiday season which starts in December.  &amp;quot;With Covid fears going away and the fast pace of vaccination, intercity bus travel should pick up once again.

Kejriwal had said all efforts were being made to address the power crisis and his government did not want that any &amp;quot;emergency situation&amp;quot; is created.  &amp;quot;The situation is very critical in the entire country. Several chief ministers have written to the Centre about it. All are trying together to improve the situation,&amp;quot; he had said.  Earlier on Monday, Delhi Power Minister Satyendar Jain had said the Delhi government has to depend on costly gas-based power as well as spot purchase at high market rate as the NTPC has halved power supply to the city from the usual 4,000 MW.  Jain had claimed most of the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) plants are running at 50-55 percent capacity as their coal stocks are reduced to meet one-two days need.  Delhi purchases most of its power from NTPC but supply has been halved, Jain had told reporters.  &amp;quot;NTPC which supplies us 4,000 MW power has reduced it to half currently. This has led us to generation of power through gas that costs Rs 17.25 per unit,&amp;quot; he had said.  Delhi has three gas-based plants with a total capacity of 1,900 MW, he had said.  &amp;quot;The Centre has terminated the quota of cheap gas. We have to purchase it and the generation cost is Rs 17.50 which is not sustainable. Also, we have to resort to spot purchase of power due to the crisis at a high rate of Rs 20 per unit,&amp;quot; Delhi power minister had said.  Jain had also said the Centre should accept that coal crisis and address it instead of being in denial mode.  Chief ministers of many states, including Yogi Adityanath of Uttar Pradesh, have written to the Centre on the issue. Punjab is also facing power cuts, he had said.  &amp;quot;If there is no power crisis, then why has Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath written a letter to the central government. There is a power crisis in the country; the central government should consider it as a problem, then only its solution can be found,&amp;quot; he had said.  The demand for electricity in Delhi at present is low. At one time, the electricity demand was more than 7,300 MW, which has come down to 4,562 MW. Even after the demand is low, we have to buy electricity at the rate of Rs 17 to Rs 20, he had said.",", Battlegrounds India, Business, Delhi, Delhi power demand, Ministry of Power, NTPC","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/ntpc-says-delhi-discoms-scheduling-only-70power-availablethem_15623181.html

However, the profit grew by 18.9 percent compared to the corresponding quarter last fiscal.  Gross revenue increased 7.8 percent sequentially to Rs 19,760.7 crore during the period, and 30.1 percent year-on-year (YoY).  IT services, which analysts largely track for Wipro, were at $2,580 million for the September quarter, increasing 6.9 percent QoQ while the YoY growth was 29.5 percent.

He further said Wipro surpassed the $10 billion milestone of annualised revenue run rate.  As regards Q3FY22, the company expects revenue from the IT services business to be in the range of $2,631 million to $2,683 million, which translates to a sequential growth of 2 percent to 4 percent.  IT services operating margin for the September 2021 quarter was at 17.8 percent, a decline of 104 bps as compared to the previous quarter, and fell 140 bps YoY.  &amp;quot;We sustained operating margins in Q2 in a narrow band even after absorbing the full impact of recent acquisitions and investing significantly in business across sales, capabilities, and talent,&amp;quot; said Jatin Dalal, Chief Financial Officer.  Wipro completed a salary increase covering 80 percent of colleagues, making it the second hike in this calendar, Dalal added.  The company added 2 clients in the $100 million+ band, taking the total to 15, and made one client addition in the $75 million+ category, increasing the total client list to 28 as of September 2021. In the $50 million+ category, it added 2 clients, 5 clients in $20 million+ band, and 6 in $10 million+ category, compared to previous quarter.  The banking, financial services, and insurance segment, which contributes 34.8 percent to the total IT services business, grew by 11.1 percent sequentially, while the consumer segment, which accounts for 17.3 percent of revenue, registered 6.5 percent growth QoQ in the September quarter.

The net profit marks an increase of 11.9 percent year-on-year and 4.4 percent compared to Rs 5,195 crore in the June quarter, on the back of strong revenue contribution from Daimler deal, higher adoption of digital transformation by clients, broad-based growth across verticals and geographies, and strong seasonality. This was despite a reduction in other income which declined significantly by 15.8% sequentially and by 8% YOY.  (It may be noted that Daimler and Infosys had announced a long-term strategic partnership for a technology-driven IT infrastructure transformation in Dec&rsquo;2020. Through this partnership, Daimler AG will transform its IT operating model and infrastructure landscape across workplace services, service desk, data center, networks, and SAP Basis together with Infosys. The total deal amount was about $3.2 billion.)

Revenue from digital business contributed 56.1% to total revenues and was up 42.4% on a YOY basis.  Due to the supply side issues faced by the company and the industry as a whole, the company had to incur more to retain the talent which was accompanied by wage hikes across lower and middle levels. The employee cost increased by 3.4% sequentially and by 17.5% on a YOY basis. The hikes given by the company, however, were not enough to control the attrition which jumped to 20.1% from 13.1% sequentially.  The supply-side issue also resulted in the increase in the cost of sub-contractors which saw a spike of 24.4% sequentially and a huge jump of 87% on a YOY basis.  Operating margins were down due to supply-side headwinds and for the quarter stood at 23.6% which was 10 bps lower than the previous quarter and was down 180 bps on a YOY basis.  Commenting on the margins, Nilanjan Roy, Chief Financial Officer, said &ldquo;Our operating margins for Q2 were resilient; the impact of enhanced employee value proposition initiatives was offset by strong operating parameters, cost optimization, and operating leverage.&rdquo;  The net margin for the quarter is 18.3% which is down by 30 bps sequentially and 140 bps YOY.  The company signed large deals to the tune of $2.15 billion which complements the already very healthy order book and pipeline in digital transformation space for the company.  The company has also declared an interim dividend of Rs. 15/share.  Parekh said, given the continued momentum we have further increased our revenue growth guidance to 16.5%-17.5% from 14%-16% given earlier.

This comes after persistent glitches that Infosys&rsquo; new e-filing portal faced since its launch on June 7.  This forced Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to call Infosys&rsquo; executives for meeting twice, in June and on August 23. Sitharaman gave the IT major time till September 15 to get the portal in order.  Infosys was in 2019 awarded a Rs 4,200 crore contract to develop the new filing portal to replace the old one to reduce the processing time from 63 days to one.  The idea was to have a taxpayer-friendly portal that was simple to use and expedited refunds but the portal has been more in news for being inaccessible than making the process smooth. The portal was launched on June 7, 2021, amid peak tax season and things started going downhill from the word go.","Infosys, Results","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/chandra-r-srikanth-14701/', 'name': 'Chandra R Srikanth'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/results/infosys-ceo-says-income-tax-portal-seeing-steady-progress-19-crore-returns-filed_15626881.html

Daimler deal contributed 1.5% to revenues. Infy&rsquo;s revenue from digital business showed sustained strong growth (9.8% QoQ, 43% YoY USD) and now account to 56% vs 47.3% in 2Q21. Deal TCV of $2.15 Bn, was soft on -17% QoQ and -32% YoY basis. Net new deals were moderate at 37% of TCV, however, management mentioned demand environment is extremely strong. Deal pipeline is robust with good mix of small, mid-sized and large deals. We are not worried by weak TCV as we believe large deal momentum will be back in FY23E when supply side pressure eases out. Infy reported margin of 23.6%, -12bps QoQ much above our &amp;amp;amp; cons estimates (Ple: 22.5%, Cons:22.5%). Margins were stable on QoQ basis despite wage hike for junior employees and supply side cost pressures led by operating leverage and cost efficiencies. LTM IT services attrition increased sharply to 20.1%, +620 bps QoQ. Infosys plans to contain attrition through selective skill-based and performance-based compensation hikes in 3Q. Total fresher hiring target for FY22 is also revised for second consecutive quarter to 45K from earlier 35K (25K previously). Management is confident of sustaining margins within guidance band of 22-24% despite supply side pressures.  Outlook We already baked in 18%/12.8% growth for FY22/23. Our EPS estimates increased marginally by ~1% for FY22/23/24E. We arrive at DCF based TP of INR 2004 (implied target multiple of 28x P/E on FY24 EPS).

However, the management indicated good traction in medium and small size deals, and reiterated that the pipeline remains strong on robust demand. EBIT margin dipped 10bp QoQ to 23.6%, above our estimate of 22.3%, despite the impact of higher subcontracting expenses and wage hike in 2QFY22. Utilization (+70bp QoQ) and offshore mix (+50bp) remains stretched, despite strong hiring (11.7k, up 4.4%) in 2QFY22. We were positively surprised by the increase in its FY22 USD revenue growth guidance to 16.5-17.5% YoY CC (from 14-16%), an increase of 200bp at the mid-point v/s our expectation of a 100bp rise.

","Motilal Oswal's research report on Wipro WPRO reported a strong (8.1% QoQ CC) revenue growth in IT Services in 2QFY22, ahead of our estimate of 6.9%. Organic growth (excluding Capco) of 4.5% QoQ also came in ahead of our estimate. The management highlighted that the growth was broad based in 2QFY22, including at Capco, which it is delivering ahead of plan. Despite a M&amp;amp;amp;A impact and wage hike, EBIT margin in IT Services was flat QoQ (excluding a one-off in 1QFY22) at 17.8%, 170bp ahead of our estimate. It reported a TCV of USD580m in 2QFY22, down 19% QoQ. Deal TCV is up 19% YoY in 1HFY22. WPRO&rsquo;s operational metrics remain impacted by supply tightness, with attrition increasing by 500bp QoQ to 20.5% and utilization (excluding trainees) of 89.2% (+240bp QoQ), despite adding 11.5k employees (5.5% of its 1QFY22 strength). The management expects attrition to further inch up in 3QFY22 and said it will take a few quarters to normalize. 3QFY22 revenue growth guidance of 2-4% QoQ (including impact of Ampion acquisition) was in line with our estimate. We see the guidance as positive, given the supply constraints and seasonality, but remain watchful on margin as the company continues to operate ahead of its guidance of 17-17.5%. We now expect FY22 IT Services&rsquo; revenue growth at 28% (19.5% YoY organic growth). With better than expected margin performance, we have raised our FY22E/FY23E EBIT margin estimate by 100bp/30bp, which will result in a FY21-23E PAT growth of 13%.  Outlook The management&rsquo;s growth strategy, continued investment in talent, and a simplified operational model to help improve the focus on customers has started to play out and will support valuation, but the current valuation of 27x FY23E P/E is fairly baking in this improvement.

The latest data indicates that the crunch situation on account of short supply of coal is easing. Various power plants in different parts of the country are grappling with fuel shortages and efforts are being made to increase fuel supplies.  Power System Operation Corporation Ltd (POSOCO) reported that the total capacity of units under outage due to low coal stocks has reduced from 11 GW on October 12 to 5 GW on October 14, the ministry said in a statement. Outage refers to non-generation of power on account of coal shortage.  On Wednesday, the ministry said that coal power generation capacity under outage had reduced to 6 GW on October 13. In one day, 1 GW of power capacity has been brought on stream amid the ongoing coal crisis.  According to a fact sheet on power supply to the national capital provided by the ministry on Thursday, the maximum demand of Delhi was 4,382 MW (peak) and 95.4 MU (Million Units of energy) on October 13.  As per the information received from Delhi discoms, there was no outage on account of power shortage as the required amount of power was supplied to them.  The ministry also said the discoms or power distribution companies have an allocation of 756 MW from Dadri Stage-I and were offered 9.5 MU on October 13.  However, the ministry said that no power was drawn by the discoms. This power was in addition to the different allocations to the Delhi discoms provided by state-owned NTPC and Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC).  The fact sheet showed that there was no energy deficit in the city from September 28 to October 13. In Delhi, 95.4 MU of electricity were available against a requirement of 95.4 MU on October 13.  In Delhi, 101.5 MU of electricity were available against a requirement of 101.5 MU on October 12.  Therefore, energy demand started moderating in Delhi with the onset of autumn, as per the fact sheet.  According to the ministry, energy availability was higher than the requirement on October 11. On that day, 101.9 MU of electricity was available whereas the requirement was 101.1 MU.  It also showed that peak power demand and peak power demand met (supply) remained the same during the period till October 13.  The discoms in Delhi had drawn less power than made available to them, according to the fact sheet.  Further, it showed that coal plants of NTPC offered 17.04 MU of electricity to Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd (DDL) against the allocated 18.96 MU.  But the Tata Power DDL had drawn 16.35 MU, which was 95.95 per cent of the energy made available to it by the coal-based power plants of NTPC.  Similarly, power made available by Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) and NTPC (gas) to the discoms in Delhi was more than that drawn by these utilities.  BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd and BSES Yamuna Power Ltd are the other two discoms in the national capital.","Business, coal, coal shortage, India, NTPC, POSOCO, Power Ministry, Power System Operation Corporation Ltd","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/coal-power-generation-capacity-under-outage-reduces-to-5-gw-power-ministry_15630401.html

Growth in all the bank&rsquo;s key parameters is expected in double digits and its asset quality will likely be stable in the three months ended September 30.  Profit, which increased 18.4 percent to Rs 7,513 crore in the September quarter of last year, may grow with support from other income, pre-provision operating profit, net interest income and stable asset quality.

The bank&rsquo;s shares have gained 13 percent since the start of the September quarter.  Net interest income, the difference between the interest earned and expended, could rise by about 10 percent YoY on loan growth of 15.4 percent, with the net interest margin likely unchanged at 4 percent.  &ldquo;We expect net interest income growth at around 11 percent YoY led by loan growth of around 15 percent YoY (weaker auto sales and lower credit card receivables growth offset by higher SME growth). We expect net interest margin to be unchanged at 4 percent.

According to Kotak, pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) growth could be about 12 percent YoY as business growth is still not normal. Prabhudas Lilladher also expects the same growth in PPoP.  Asset quality  Analysts expect a fall in slippages at HDFC Bank with better loan recovery. Asset quality is likely to improve or remain stable compared with the previous quarter.  &ldquo;We expect the gross non-performing loan ratio to decline, led by lower slippages (2 percent) and better recovery (expect a bullish commentary of the recovery environment). Near-term focus would be on growth recovery of segments that would drive this growth,&rdquo; said Kotak.  Asset quality in agri/unsecured book, slippages due to the second Covid-19 wave, and commentary on credit cards and fee income traction are key, said Motilal Oswal.

On a year-on-year (YOY) basis, there was an increase of 13 percent from the adjusted net profit of Rs 1,166 crore.  Revenue  Consolidated revenue came in at Rs 12,017 crore, higher by 1.6 percent compared to Rs 11,830 crore in June 2021 quarter. On a YOY basis, the revenue was higher by 15.7 percent from Rs. 10,387 crore.  Volumes  The total consolidated volumes for the company stood at 21.64 million tonnes, a growth of 8 percent. Volumes for grey cement have grown on a YOY basis by 8 percent to 19.9 million tonnes. The company added 43 new Ready-mix concrete (RMC) plants during the quarter, taking the total of RMC plants to 148. White cement volumes grew by 17 percent YOY to 0.34 million tonnes. There was a reduction in exports and others due to COVID restrictions of about 45 percent which came in at 0.21 million tonnes. Overseas grey cement volumes were stagnant at 1.21 million tonnes.  Overall, the company witnessed a growth in volumes across regions except central India where demand was more or less stagnant, and eastern India where the volumes went down due to rains and COVID restrictions. Strong demand growth was witnessed in Western India, especially Maharashtra &amp;amp;amp; Gujarat where demand was pushed both by urban and rural demand as well as housing and infrastructure segment.  Costs  Raw material, logistics, and energy costs for the company witnessed an upward trajectory during the quarter. Raw materials costs (slag, gypsum, and HSD) which constitute 13 percent of total costs, were higher by 3 percent on a YOY / 2 percent on a QOQ basis and clocked Rs 518/tonne. The rise in diesel prices also impacted the input costs.  Energy costs which constitute 28 percent of the total costs were highly impacted due to rising coal and petcoke prices. Energy costs were higher by 17 percent YOY / 8 percent on a sequential basis and touched Rs 1099/tonne. This was despite the fact that the company consumed 4 percent less power and built-in operational efficiencies. Green power fulfilled 13.7 percent of the total power requirement.  To reduce dependence on higher-priced coal purchases, the company expects to commence mining operations at its Bicharpur coal block in Madhya Pradesh during Q3FY22.  Logistics costs (contributing 31 percent to total costs) were higher by 7 percent YOY / 3 percent QOQ to Rs 1,219/tonne due to rising oil prices which increased by 21 percent YOY. The company was able to partially mitigate the inflated fuel prices with improved efficiencies.  Packing cost was also higher by 25 percent YOY and 20 percent from the previous quarter.  As a result, the company&rsquo;s total costs as a percentage of total revenue witnessed an increase of 3 percent on a YOY basis and of 5 percent from the previous quarter.  Margins  Higher costs adversely impacted the operating and net margins. Operating margins were down 370 bps on a sequential basis and by 130 bps on a YOY basis. Similarly, net margins were down 350 bps sequentially and by 30 bps on a YOY basis.  New Capacity Additions  The company commissioned a new capacity of 1.2 mtpa in the month of Oct&rsquo;21. 0.6 mtpa was commissioned at Patliputra Cement Works in Bihar and 0.6 mtpa at Dankuni Cement Works in West Bengal, which is the first phase of its capacity expansion plans of 19.5 mtpa that were announced in December of last year. These additions will help meet the growing demand in the eastern region.  The total cement manufacturing capacity in India for the company now stands at 112.55 mtpa.  Green Initiatives  In the last two years, the company has scaled up its renewable energy capacity by 2.5 times and expects it to fulfill 34 percent of its power requirement by 2024 from the current levels of 13 percent. The company has set a target to move to completely (100 percent) switch to renewable energy by 2050.  Recovery in rural and urban demand in both housing and infrastructure sectors across regions is expected to be challenged by the increase in input and energy costs. However, the company hopes to mitigate the same by building sustainable efficiencies across the chain and bypassing some costs to the consumers by increasing the prices.  In the press release, the company said, &ldquo;UltraTech is confident of weathering the storm of increase in prices of coal, diesel, and other inputs, with its sustainable efficiency improvement programs, accompanied by an increase in selling prices to absorb the increase in costs.&rdquo;  The stock closed at Rs. 7,399 today, up Rs. 3.80 from its previous day&rsquo;s close. It has generated returns of about 65 percent over a period of 1 year, 39.92 percent in this financial year, and 1 percent over the past 3 months.

The headline NPA ratio improved by 12bps qoq to 1.4% due to lower slippages and better recoveries, but higher restructuring at 1.7% of loans (mainly in PL) was slightly disappointing. Credit growth improved to 15.5% yoy/4.5% qoq due to better traction in retail loans (up 13% yoy) and commercial loans (up 28% yoy). Wholesale loan growth moderated to 6% yoy, but the bank sees improving growth opportunities in the corporate segment.

HDFCB has adopted liberal restructuring (borrower-wise) in the retail segment, but expects a low relapse rate (10-20bps of overall loans).

","The FMCG giant, Nestle India is expected to see its revenues at Rs 3,900 crore with an increase of 11-14&nbsp;percent on-quarter&nbsp;and by 8-11&nbsp;percent over the last year, experts suggest. They expect the EBITDA to increase by about 11&nbsp;percent QoQ and by about 7-8&nbsp;percent YoY to Rs 950 crore. The company's PAT is expected at Rs 625 crore which is an increase of about 15&nbsp;percent QoQ and 6&nbsp;percent YoY.  According to&nbsp;ICICI Direct, the revenues are expected to grow because the demand for milk-based products&nbsp;and&nbsp;noodles has remained strong. The price hikes implemented by the company are also likely to partially contribute to growth.  KR Choksey expects a double-digit growth in domestic sales, driven by an increased demand for ready-to-eat food products and anticipated significant increase for in-home consumption.  The company is aiming to expand its rural distribution channel to benefit from the rising consumption levels in smaller cities and villages and the e-commerce channel is also growing at a faster&nbsp;clip&nbsp;which will benefit the company.  &ldquo;We expect domestic volume growth to accelerate as chocolate consumption comes back and challenges relating to manufacturing ease off,&rdquo; said a report from Phillip Capital.  As per the experts, the company's gross margins are expected to witness a YoY contraction of 125 bps on account of inflationary pressure on input costs. Gross margin pressure will be partially negated by improvement in operational efficiencies (lower overheads) but will still result in a decline of EBITDA margins by about 100 bps.  According to&nbsp;Bloomberg data, the prices of key raw materials for the company have increased quite significantly. Palm oil prices have increased by about 60&nbsp;percent in the past one year and coffee prices have&nbsp;shot&nbsp;off&nbsp; 57.5&nbsp;percent.  &ldquo;We model 90 bps YoY decline in gross margin due to input cost inflation (edible oils and packaging materials), offset by selective price hikes. We expect EBITDA margin to decline 50 bps YoY with lower other expenses partly offsetting GM pressures,&rdquo; said a Kotak Securities report.  &ldquo;Higher RM costs to weigh on gross margin. Healthy operating leverage, cost efficiency programme will lead to flat EBITDA Margin,&rdquo; Phillip Capital said.  Kotak Securities expects the revenues to grow 9&nbsp;percent&nbsp;&nbsp;to Rs 3,870 crore from Rs 3,542 crore in the previous year, while EBITDA is pegged at Rs 961 crore&nbsp;- up 7&nbsp;percent from Rs 899 crore a year ago. It expects PAT to clock YoY growth of 5&nbsp;percent to Rs 635 crore from Rs 603 crore in the previous year.  HDFC Securities expect the revenues to grow 9.5&nbsp;percent YoY to Rs 3,880 crore, EBITDA to be at Rs 990 crore with a growth of 9.5&nbsp;percent YoY and PAT at 680 crore with a growth of 16.5&nbsp;percent. It expects an EBITDA margin of 25.5&nbsp;percent and a net margin of 17.5&nbsp;percent.  According to KR Choksey, the revenue are expected to be around Rs 3,914 crore with a YoY growth of 11&nbsp;percent, EBITDA at Rs 971 crore and PAT at Rs 650 crore with a respective growth of 10&nbsp;percent and 11&nbsp;percent.  It suggests that the key monitorables will be the guidance on price and volume, capacity utilisation levels, mix of segmental products, new products/innovations and cost-control initiatives. These will set the tone about the performance in the coming quarters.  Axis Securities is more conservative in its approach and expects the net profit to be flat at Rs 586 crore with revenues growing by 8&nbsp;percent to Rs 3,824 crore. &ldquo;Earnings to de-grow YoY in line with flattish operating performance and lower other income. Key monitorables will be the outlook on consumption trend; raw material prices, pricing action and new product development launch pipeline,&rdquo; it said.

The company will release its September quarter earnings on October 19 and what kind of direction the stock price will get from these earnings will be largely seen.

Experts largely expect the company to grow its revenue in double digits with growth from all segments as the consumer demand improved better compared to June quarter that was hit by lockdown in several states to control the spread of second Covid wave. Also the growth in key segments was flattish in the base quarter (Q2FY21).

Operating Performance  Experts feel there could be contraction in gross margin on account of higher input prices, though the price hikes could help gross margin improve on sequential basis.  &amp;quot;Higher input prices, including palm oil, LAB (petroleum derivatives) and caustic soda, would result in a 202-bps decline in the gross margins.

Thus, over strong operating profit we expect a robust free cash flow generation of Rs150bn over FY22‐23E despite the ongoing CAPEX.  Outlook The Net Debt/EBITDA continue to remain at a bottom low of 0.47x in Q2FY22 v/s 0.44x in last quarter. At the CMP stock trades at 17/14.9x of EBITDA on FY22E/FY23E. Thus, we retain our BUY recommendation with a TP of Rs8,600 (unchanged), valuing the stock at 16x EV/EBITDA (unchanged) on FY23E on the back of strong realization, robust demand scenario, UTCEM&rsquo;s ability to pass on inflating cost and capacity addition.

The company was able to mitigate the rise in commodity prices, especially edible oils and packaging materials with better realisations. ","FMCG giant Nestle India on October 19 reported a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 617 crore for the quarter ended September 2021 (Q3FY22), a growth of 15 percent from Rs 538.6 crore reported in the previous quarter. Profit grew by 5 percent on a year-on-year (YOY) basis from Rs 587.1 crore.  It must be noted that Nestle India follows a January to December financial year.  Revenues came in higher by 12 percent at Rs 3,882.6 crore for the quarter, compared to Rs 3,476.7 crore in June 2021 quarter. On a YOY basis, the numbers grew by 10 percent from Rs 3,541 crore.  Growth in revenue came mainly from broad-based domestic sales growth which increased by 10.1 percent and was largely driven by volume and mix. Exports witnessed a marginal growth of 1.3 percent.  &ldquo;This quarter has once again seen the Company deliver &lsquo;double‐digit broad‐based value growth&rsquo; in domestic sales across categories. Organized trade witnessed a resurgence in the third quarter with strong revenue growth in mid‐twenties after a muted second quarter which was impacted by the pandemic second wave&rdquo;, commented Mr. Suresh Narayanan, Chairman, and Managing Director.  He further said the e‐commerce channel showed strong acceleration on the back of convenience and pandemic driven consumer behaviour, fully leveraged by a team who used the power of meaningful shopper insights, data analytics, speed, flexibility, sharp communication and customisation for the channel at scale.  The company witnessed an overall broad-based double-digit growth not only in large metros but also in small towns owing to smart management of its product portfolio relevant to the specific markets. The company said it was laying strong emphasis on the customised portfolio, enhanced distribution infrastructure and deployment of resources, localised communication, enhanced visibility and building consumer connect.  &ldquo;This sustainable growth is a testimony to the unwavering determination, commitment, and resolute focus of our people and partners towards being a &lsquo;Force for Good&rsquo;&rdquo;, expressed Narayanan.  EBITDA margins at 25.3 percent declined marginally by 60 bps on a YOY basis and were flat on a sequential basis. The company was able to mitigate the rise in commodity prices, especially edible oils and packaging materials with better realisations. This is visible in the marginal rise in the cost of materials consumed as a percentage of sales.  Business Segment Performance  The company expects its e-commerce business to continue to grow and is witnessing a lot of traction in this segment. E‐commerce as a channel is developing new models like Quick Commerce (hyper‐local) leading to lower delivery lead times, effectively improving the shopper experience.  Organised trade for the company witnessed a broad-based growth across all food and beverages categories especially coffee and confectionary due to a decrease in pandemic intensity and increased vaccination across India.  &amp;quot;Out of Home (OOH) business is witnessing a pick-up in demand with the opening up of Hotels, Offices, and Malls with some geographies already seeing demand at pre-pandemic levels,&amp;quot; the company said.  It launched Maggi Noodles and Polo in export markets of the Middle East and Crunch wafers in the ASEAN region.  Product Category Performance  The company witnessed a high single-digit volume and mix growth in all its product categories in the domestic market.  Prepared Dishes and Cooking Aids: This category witnessed good growth on the back of continuing momentum and improved availability. Growth was more prominent in Maggi Noodles and Maggi Masala-ae-Magic, while the growth in Maggi Sauces was muted due to lower pickup by retail customers and higher competition.  Milk Products and Nutrition: Toddler range (CEREGROW, NANGROW) and MILKMAID posted strong double-digit growth.  Confectionery: Intensive media campaigns and consumer promotions aided the chocolate brands like Kitkat, Munch, and Milkybar to achieve high double-digit growth.  Beverages: Nescafe Classic also grew in strong double digits due to sustained demand, better penetration, and visibility.  The company commissioned its ninth plant in India in Sanand this quarter. Narayanan expressed his happiness on this milestone, saying &ldquo;With over 60 percent of the factory workforce being women, it is the largest contingent of any such workforce of the Company. This will rank amongst the highest proportion in the manufacturing sector in India.&nbsp;Equipped with the state‐of‐the‐art biomass boiler, Sanand factory aspires to be a zero‐carbon emission unit.&rdquo;  Dividend  The&nbsp;company declared a second interim dividend for 2021 of Rs 110.00 per equity share (Face value Rs 10/- per equity share)&nbsp;which will be paid on and from November 16, 2021. This is in addition to the first interim dividend of 25.00 per equity share paid on May 19, 2021.  In the short to medium term, the company expects the raw material costs (wheat, edible oils, coffee) to remain high while packaging costs are expected to move northwards amid supply constraints and rising fuel costs.  The stock closed at Rs 19377.50 today on the BSE, down Rs 49.75 against its previous day&rsquo;s close. It has generated returns of 20.4 percent over the past one year, 5.3 percent in this financial year, 9.1 percent during the last three months and -4 percent in the past one month.","Nestle India, Results","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/results/nestle-india-q3-results-|-profit-rises-5-yoy-to-rs-617-crore-revenue-comesat-rs-3883-crore_15645381.html

1152,2021-10-20 13:28:46+05:30,Nestle India Ltd.,NESTLEIND,Nestle India&rsquo;s September quarter just about satiating. Higher input costs pose risk,"Nestle India&rsquo;s revenue was in line with expectations, although margins were a sore point. Going ahead, higher input costs are a concern for margins.","Nestle India&rsquo;s September quarter revenue was broadly in line with expectations, although margins were a sore point.&nbsp;The gross profit margin contracted by 242 basis points (bps) year-on-year to 55.5 percent in the three months ended September owing to higher commodity prices. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.  Nestle India&rsquo;s margin stood at a 17-quarter low, according to ICICI Securities. Investors can expect margin pressures to continue, given the steep rise in input costs.  &ldquo;Price outlook for key categories like wheat, coffee, edible oils remains firm to bullish while costs of packaging materials continue to increase amid supply constraints, rising fuel and transportation costs. Input prices expected to be on bullish trend both globally and to some extent locally,&rdquo; Nestl&eacute; India said in a statement on October 19.  Nestl&eacute; India&rsquo;s total sales increased 9.6 percent to Rs 3,865 crore from a year earlier. Exports accounted for about 5 percent of operating revenue and grew by a mere 1 percent. Domestic sales contributed the remaining revenue with a 10 percent growth.  Maggi Noodles and Maggi Masala‐ae‐Magic posted healthy growth. On the other hand, Maggi Sauces saw somewhat muted growth owing to decreased in‐home consumption, high base and increased competitive intensity.  Also read:&nbsp;Nestle India: Should you buy, sell, or hold it after Q3 figures?  The toddler range (Ceregrow, Nangrow) and Milkmaid posted strong double-digit growth. Power brands Kitkat, Munch and Milkybar saw high double-digit growth.  Overall, the subdued margins, higher finance costs and tax outgo meant Nestl&eacute; India&rsquo;s net profit grew 5 percent to Rs 617 crore.  To be sure, the growth outlook for packaged foods in India is robust and that augurs well for Nestl&eacute; India.  &ldquo;Our long-term positive view is intact driven by (1) structural tailwind from increasing consumer propensity to consume packaged foods, (2) continued investment behind brands, (3) renewed focus on distribution expansion, particularly rural and e-commerce and (4) significant increase in capex (Rs 2,600 crore planned over CY20-23 which is = cumulative capex of CY12-19),&rdquo; ICICI Securities analysts said in a report on October 20.  The only hiccup is that valuations of Nestl&eacute; India shares are pricey. The stock has advanced by about 14 percent from its pre-pandemic highs in early 2020.  As analysts from Motilal Oswal Financial Services point out, &ldquo;Valuations at 60.8 times CY23E earnings per share (EPS) are, however, expensive and do not offer any upside from a one-year perspective.

The Pankaj Munjal-led company, which is part of the HMC Group, wants to expand globally, especially in the high-margin European market, where it wants to break into the league of the top five bicycle producers. To push product and market expansion globally, Hero Cycles is in the advanced stages of finalising the buyout of two companies outside India. &ldquo;We will announce something this month (October) and something again in November,&rdquo; chairman Munjal told Moneycontrol. &ldquo;These are decent-sized companies from Japan and Europe, but we can disclose the deal size only later.&rdquo; Once the two acquisitions are concluded, Hero Cycles will clear the decks to raise a minimum of $200 million through stake sales in group entities. &ldquo;We are looking for dilution in Hero International, Firefox and Hero Motors. We will not dilute more than 20-25 percent. We are looking at a bigger road map for the future. We want to be among the top five players in Europe by 2024,&rdquo; Munjal added. Currently, 50 percent of Hero Cycle&rsquo;s turnover is generated outside India. The company has strengthened its footprint in Europe over the past few years through Hero International. In 2015, Hero acquired Manchester, UK-based Insync Bikes, which was followed by the buyout of Berlin-headquartered HNF Nicolai in 2020. In May 2021, Hero Cycles appointed Jeff Weiss, a bicycle industry veteran with 20 years&rsquo; experience, as CEO of London-based Hero International to head the European operations and steer the expansion plans. As per the Confederation of the European Bicycle, E-Bike, Parts &amp;amp;amp; Accessories Industries (CONEBI), the European bicycle market was valued at 18.3 billion euros in 2020, or 22 million units. &ldquo;We have invested Rs 300-350 crore in e-cycle valley in Ludhiana and about Rs 200 crore will be invested in England, Germany and Slovakia ,where we are expanding operations,&rdquo; Munjal said. &ldquo;The best companies in the world are talking to us. Our large working capital is getting locked in; we are building more capacity in Europe. In three months, we will have the funds raised in one company and two more in six months.&rdquo; Electric bicycles or e-cycles have caught the fancy of most international markets, especially in Europe. Sales of e-cycles closed at 10.6 billion euros in 2020, as per CONEBI. Bajaj Auto&rsquo;s European partner KTM had ventured into the e-cycles segment and launched them in Germany, Austria, Netherlands and other European markets. IPO plan Over the medium-term, Hero Cycles is looking to become only the second Hero-branded company to go public. Munjal&rsquo;s cousin, Pawan Munjal, is the promoter of Hero MotoCorp, the only Hero-branded company on the stock exchanges and also the country&rsquo;s biggest manufacturer of two-wheelers. Asked when Hero Cycles would debut on the stock exchanges, Munjal said, &ldquo;I cannot give you a timeline but a lot can happen by FY24.&rdquo; The two acquisitions lined up by the company will help it reach the targeted turnover for the year. This year (FY22) the group will look to reach Rs 4,400-4,500 crore, which would be a growth of 33 percent over FY21&rsquo;s turnover of Rs 3,300 crore. &ldquo;In FY23, the turnover should touch Rs 6,500 crore,&rdquo; Munjal said.","Auto, Business, Hero Cycles, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/exclusive-|-pankaj-munjalâs-hero-cycles-plans-ipo-fundraisingacquisitions_15665981.html

The management stated that material cost inflation was the highest in four decades, and it expects this trend to persist over the near term. Further price hikes (in addition to a 4% increase in 2QFY22 and 3.5% increase in 1QFY22), cost savings, and raw material substitution could mitigate the sequential impact going forward. While the demand outlook remains strong, the company is also confronted with a higher base in 2HFY22, with sales growth of 25.2%/43.5% in 3QFY21/4QFY21. The company's focus on topline growth and ensuing market share gains would lead to healthy earnings over the medium-to-long term.

Gross and operating margins fell ~10ppts due to the steep rise in input costs and slower price increases. Growth momentum was stronger as sales rose 33% (9% beat). In order to improve margins, management plans to expedite price increases and focus on formulation efficiencies. APNT expects margins to return to the normal range of 18-20% by Q4. We hence trim our margin forecasts from ~22% to 18.3%/19.8% for FY23/24. Growth momentum remained robust as APNT significantly outpaced most consumer peers in volume/sales growth. Bullish commentary, aggressive initiatives on portfolio and distribution expansion and revival in construction/industrial demand offer a strong outlook. Outlook With input inflation getting back to the peak, FY21 margins appear challenging. We raise sales estimates by 6%, factoring in the strong growth momentum, but reduce margin assumptions. As a result, we cut earnings estimates by 23%/13%/7% for FY22/23/24. Retain Hold with a revised TP of Rs2,800 (Rs2,960 earlier) based on 55x Dec'23E EPS.

1176,2021-10-25 21:29:02+05:30,Tata Consumer Products Ltd.,TATACONSUM,Starbucks eyes faster India expansion with new store formats,India is one of Starbucks' fastest growing markets globally. The market for coffee shops in the country has surged even as tea remains a more affordable and popular beverage.  ,"Starbucks aims to hasten its India expansion with smaller stores and drive-through outlets, the CEO of its local partner said on Monday, signalling the American coffee chain's bullish plans as the COVID-19 slowdown abates in the country.  Launched in India in 2012, Tata Starbucks - a joint venture between Starbucks and India's Tata Consumer Products - operates 233 outlets across 19 Indian cities.  Both the partners &amp;quot;are driving Tata Starbucks to be far more aggressive in store openings, new formats, and in entering new cities,&amp;quot; Sunil D'Souza, CEO of Tata Consumer Products, said in an interview on Monday.  &amp;quot;All we've got to figure out is how quickly we can scale,&amp;quot; said D'Souza. &amp;quot;We have got a window of opportunity because the competition is on the back foot.&amp;quot;  India is one of Starbucks' fastest growing markets globally. The market for coffee shops in the country has surged even as tea remains a more affordable and popular beverage.  Despite this, a fascination for coffee brands like Starbucks and Costa Coffee remains high. Most Starbucks outlets in India are large-format and designed with rich wood-panelled decor.  The company is now exploring smaller sized outlets as they can be opened faster and it is experimenting with concepts like drive-throughs after opening one in northern India last year, D'Souza said.  Tata Starbucks registered 128% revenue growth in the quarter ending September, during which it opened 14 new outlets.  &amp;quot;Am I happy with 14? Absolutely not. The target's much more&amp;quot; D'Souza said, adding the aim was to open some 40-50 outlets this year.  INFLATION WORRIES  Tata Consumer Products' consumer goods portfolio includes its eponymous salt and tea brands and other staples. It also owns the popular tea brand Tetley.  Recent inflationary pressure, driven by a surge in crude oil prices, has hit Tata and other competitors such as the local units of global consumer giants Unilever and Nestle as freight and packaging costs have surged.  Flagging concerns about higher raw-material costs and energy prices, D'Souza said Tata Consumer Products will look to control marketing and other costs to offset the impact.  &amp;quot;At least in the short to medium-term ... we've got to live with it,&amp;quot; he said, adding the company would look to raise prices slightly to boost margins, while cutting package sizes.  Even as such concerns weigh, Tata Consumer Products wants to increasingly focus on catering to Indians in rural areas, after long focusing on urban centres.  The company will increase its distributor network by around 20% in rural areas, where it plans to promote existing affordable brands, and launch new ones, D'Souza said.  &amp;amp;nbsp;","Business, Starbucks, Sunil D'Souza, Tata Consumer Products, Tata Starbucks","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/reuters-6885/', 'name': 'Reuters'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/starbucks-eyes-faster-india-expansionnew-store-formats_15669121.html

The company which makes niche bikes under the Royal Enfield brand and trucks and buses under the VE Commercial Vehicles brand faced criticism in August when the two ordinary resolutions that were passed on October 25, were clubbed together under a special resolution.  In all, the appointment of Lal as MD fetched 93.75 percent votes in favour, as per voting data disclosed by Eicher Motors. Public institutions led the protest against this resolution which saw a total of 6.25 percent votes cast against the resolution.  Lal&rsquo;s pay package got lesser resistance with only 1.44 percent votes cast against it. 98.56 percent votes were found to be in favour of this ordinary resolution. Both the resolutions will remain in effect for a period of five years starting May 1, 2021.  The nomination and remuneration committee of Eicher Motors tweaked Lal&rsquo;s pay package back in August. As per the revised structure, his fixed pay, including allowances, now stands revised at Rs 12 crore per annum as against his FY21 salary of Rs 7.38 crore.  Perquisites now have a maximum limit of Rs 1 crore per annum, as against Rs 7.04 crore last year. Lal has been operating out of the UK since 2015.  As per the details provided by Eicher Motors, Lal gets a fully furnished residence and reimbursement of utilities, two company-provided and maintained cars, reimbursement of hospitalisation expenses and insurance premium for self and family, leave travel reimbursement as well as club membership for self and family. Eicher Motors has not provided any estimate of such expenses.  Lal&rsquo;s pay package also includes statutory contributions in accordance with UK laws and payment of commission subject to a maximum limit of 80 percent of fixed pay (Rs 9.6 crore).  The commission paid shall be subject to the recommendations of the NomRem Committee and subsequent approval by the board, the company clarified. While Eicher Motors did not provide an estimate on the statutory and commission packages, Lal had received a commission of Rs 6.70 crore in FY21.  After his reappointment as the MD on August 23, Eicher Motors announced a revision of Lal&rsquo;s total pay package. The company clarified that his overall remuneration, including fixed pay, perquisites, other benefits and commission, shall not exceed 1.5 percent of the net profits of the company in any particular financial year as computed in the manner referred to in Section 198 of the Companies Act, 2013. The previous cap was 3 percent.  The actual remuneration during FY21 was at 1.04 percent of profits, and it was at a lower percentage in the preceding years, Eicher Motors clarified.","Auto, Business, Eicher Motors, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/siddhartha-lal39s-reappointment-as-eicher-motors39-md-gets-shareholders39-approval_15669141.html

Sentiments on Chinese demand turned negative across the major steel consuming sectors. While, the impact of lower demand has been equally negated by stringent curbs on production. Given the restricted supplies of Chinese steel in its domestic and exports markets, global steel prices are expected to remain elevated further supported by all-time high coking coal prices. As expected, margins were expected to soften due to unsustainable coking coal prices. Nevertheless, margins are significantly above historical averages by ~30% in spite of astronomical input prices.

1183,2021-10-26 11:41:31+05:30,Eicher Motors Ltd.,EICHERMOT,Eicher Motors: Siddhartha Lal&rsquo;s reappointment as MD brings curtains to two-month long controversy,Siddhartha Lal had been in the thick of the controversy that saw proxy advisory firms raise objections,"Two months after shareholders opposed the special resolution that sought the reappointment of Eicher Motors promoter and Managing Director, Siddhartha Lal finally got the required number of votes that allows him to resume office as before.  On October 26, Eicher Motors said that it had secured the requisite number of votes for two ordinary resolutions that individually sought Lal&rsquo;s re-appointment as MD and ratify his pay.  Lal had been in the thick of the controversy that saw proxy advisory firms raise objections against Eicher Motors&rsquo; special resolution that sought Lal&rsquo;s reappointment and approve his pay package.  The controversy was further fuelled when Maruti Suzuki Chairman RC Bhargava advised to company managements to &amp;quot;curtail expenditures on themselves personally&amp;quot; with the COVID-19 pandemic highlighting the need to build internal resources.  Eicher tweaked Lal&rsquo;s pay package back in August. It brought down the cap of total payment to Lal in a year to 1.5 percent of the company&rsquo;s net profit from 3 percent earlier. Lal&rsquo;s actual remuneration during FY21 was at 1.04 percent of profits.  Lal&rsquo;s reappointment comes shortly after a slight hiccup in the decision-making structure at Royal Enfield following the sudden exit of automotive veteran and CEO Vinod Dasari. B Govindarajan, who has been the chief commercial officer of Royal Enfield, was appointed the executive director.  Selling 609,403 motorcycles in FY21 Royal Enfield is the most high-margin and profitable automotive entity in India. Lal has been credited with turning around Royal Enfield&rsquo;s fortunes after taking on the MD&rsquo;s role in FY07 when its volumes stood at 32,612 units. The niche bike brand has a market share of 94 percent in the middleweight (250cc-750cc) motorcycle category.  Lal also successfully brought on board Swedish commercial vehicle giant Volvo into a joint venture with Eicher Motors. Over the course of the last several years the VE Commercial Vehicles rolled out several truck and bus models. The brand claims to have a market share of 30.1 percent in the light and medium duty CV segment as at the end of FY21.  Besides managing the shift to electric mobility, both under Royal Enfield and VE Commercial Vehicles, Lal has to also defend its turf from competition. More companies are looking to have Royal Enfield-type bikes than ever before.  While Honda and Mahindra-owned Jawa have debuted in the middleweight segment with offerings that are similar to those offered by Royal Enfield, the combine of Bajaj Auto and Triumph, TVS Motor Company-owned Norton and the combine of Hero MotoCorp and Harley-Davidson are readying new products for the same segment.","Auto, Business, Eicher Motors, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/eicher-motors-siddhartha-lalâs-reappointment-as-md-brings-curtains-to-two-month-long-controversy_15673001.html

The jewellery business grew by 78 percent, watches &amp;amp;amp; wearables 73 percent, eyewear 74 percent and 121 percent growth was registered in other businesses.  The average operational store days were more than 90 percent during the quarter.  Experts expect a 64 percent growth in revenues year-on-year from Rs 4,318 crore and sequential growth of 117 percent from Rs 3,249 crore.  &ldquo;Excluding bullion sales of Rs 391 crore in the base quarter, the jewellery segment grew 78 percent in Q2FY22 with a strong 2-year CAGR of 32 percent, aided by pent-up demand and a 10 percent store addition CAGR (414 jewellery stores vs. 345 in Q2FY20),&rdquo; Emkay Research analysts says.  Demand recovery  In its quarterly update, the company said, pent-up demand after the second wave was seen in gift purchases, occasions, milestone buying, weddings and investments in gold.  While studded sales saw strong double-digit growth, the studded mix was lower than pre-Covid levels due to higher growth in plain gold sales.  Watches and eyewear segments also posted a strong recovery and returned to pre-Covid levels with a 2-year revenue CAGR of -2 percent and 3 percent, respectively.  Emkay said the faster recovery in this segment was aided by a 2 percent/6 percent store addition CAGR in watches/eyewear, improvement in mall walk-ins and consistent growth in the e-commerce channels.  Titan added eight stores for watches and 24 for eyewear during the September quarter.  Caratlane&rsquo;s business remained strong, with 95 percent growth, driven by the launch of new merchandise and marketing initiatives.  Other businesses (Taneira, fragrances and accessories) grew 121 percent, aided by higher operational stores and healthy recovery in retail, department stores and e-commerce, the company said.  What to expect  Emkay expects faster share gain from unorganised players in the jewellery business since Titan&rsquo;s entire network of stores is hallmarking-compliant.  It expects the company to report Q2 revenues of Rs 7,070 crore, with a YoY growth of 63.7 percent and a 117.6 percent growth on a QoQ basis.

It expects the standalone revenue to grow by 63.3 percent to Rs 7,053 crore YoY basis and 117.1 percent on a QOQ basis.  Motilal Oswal says stable gold prices are positive for jewellery demand and expects a YoY growth of 63.8 percent in revenues.  Based on strong growth across businesses, experts expect phenomenal growth in EBITDA and EBITDA margins.  Kotak expects a 195 percent YoY growth in EBITDA to Rs 867 crore from Rs 294 crore reported last year. It expects EBITDA margins to improve by 550 bps YoY to 12.3 percent.  &ldquo;We expect EBIT margin of 11.7 percent for jewellery business, 13 percent EBIT margin for watches segment and 17 percent EBIT margin for eyewear segment. We model 37 percent jewellery EBIT growth on two-year CAGR basis for the quarter,&rdquo; Kotak said.  Emkay expects an EBITDA of Rs 816 crore, a 177.7 percent YoY growth. The EBITDA margin is expected to grow by 470 bps on to 11.5 percent.  Motilal Oswal, on the other hand, expects an EBITDA of Rs 800 crore with a YoY growth of 155 percent and an EBITDA margin of 10.7 percent.

This led to EBITDA and PAT surpassing our estimates by more than 20%. What was even more remarkable was that this margin improvement was achieved in a quarter that still did not see the contribution from Studded jewellery returning to normal levels and witnessed low margin bullion sales as well. Nevertheless, the sharp increase in sales is likely to have helped TTAN on the operating leverage front. Management has stated that it aims to keep jewellery margins in the 12-13% range. Jewellery outlook remains good as well, given the healthy festive season commentary. Management has also indicated significant expansion plans in the company&rsquo;s smaller businesses like Eyewear and Taneira. Maintain Buy. Outlook At its current valuation of 79.3x FY23E EPS, the stock&rsquo;s near-term multiples appear expensive, although its long runway for profitable growth warrants premium multiples.

It expects price erosion to continue to&nbsp;put pressure on US revenue.  It estimates an EBITDA of Rs 1,116 crore, down 8.6% on a yearly basis and up 23.7% sequentially. Therefore, EBITDA margins are expected&nbsp;to be 21.4%, down 355 bps y-o-y and higher by 305 bps sequentially.

The revenues came in&nbsp;higher&nbsp;by 18% at Rs 5,763 crore for the quarter, compared to Rs 4,897 crore in the same period last year. Sequentially, the&nbsp;consolidated revenue increased by 17% from Rs 4,919 crore reported in the previous quarter.  The revenues are higher due to growth in its generics business which grew 19% y-o-y across geographies and strong growth in its proprietary business which had a robust growth of 195% on an annualized basis albeit on a low base.  Commenting on the results, Co-Chairman &amp;amp;amp; MD, G V Prasad said &amp;quot;I am pleased with the improvement in the financial performance across our businesses.

Revenue &amp;amp;amp; Geographical Mix  Revenue from global generics business came in higher at Rs 4,743 crore in this quarter compared to Rs 3,984 crore in the corresponding period last year. On a sequential basis, this business grew by 15% from Rs 4,111 crore on the back of higher contribution from COVID portfolio, new product launches and volume growth across markets. However, the company witnessed price erosion in some of its markets which restricted the growth.  North America continues to be the biggest contributor to the generics business contributing Rs 1,891 crore this quarter as against Rs 1,832 crore in the previous year, a y-o-y growth of 3%. Sequential growth was 9% from Rs 1,739 crore in the previous quarter.  The company has a strong product pipeline and said, &ldquo;We filed two new ANDAs (Abbreviated New Drug Application) during the quarter. As of 30th September 2021, cumulatively 93 generic filings are pending for approval with the USFDA (90 ANDAs and 3 NDAs (New Drug Application) under S0S(b)(2) route).

India too grew strongly by 25% to Rs 1,140 crore from Rs 912 crore last year and by 8% on a sequential basis from Rs 1,060 crore, driven by increase in sales volumes of our existing products, including COVID products, new product launches and increase in sales price of existing products.  Europe on the other hand grew by 10% y-o-y to Rs 414 crore from Rs 375 crore. Sequentially it grew by 4% from Rs 399 crore, primarily on account of volume traction in base business and new product launches across markets, partially offset by price erosion.  Revenues from Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients (PSAI) business fell marginally by 2% y-o-y from Rs 851 crore to Rs 837 crore, however this business grew 11% sequentially from Rs 754 crore.  Proprietary products and others contributed Rs 183 crore, growing 195% on a y-o-y basis from Rs 62 crore and by 238% q-o-q from Rs 54 crore on account of recognition of a license fee associated with the sale of our U.S. and Canada territory rights celecoxib oral solution, to BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc.  Margins  Gross margins for the quarter stood at 53.4%, down 50 bps from last year mainly on account of price erosion and lower export benefits. There was however, a sequential increase of 120 bps at the back of leverage benefit on manufacturing overheads, which was partially offset by price erosion.  EBITDA came in at Rs 1,560 crore and margins improved by 110 bps on an annualized basis to 27% in this quarter, and by 630 bps on a q-o-q basis.  Net margin was up by 160 bps y-o-y to 17.2% and 560 bps on a sequential basis.  The capex is planned at Rs 360 crore in this financial year and has a free cash flow of Rs 83 crore.

Thierry Bollore, Jaguar Land Rover&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer, commented, &ldquo;The global semi-conductor shortage remains challenging but I&rsquo;m pleased to see the actions we have been implementing reduce the impact. With strong customer demand with a record order book, we are well placed to return to strong financial performance as semiconductor supply begins to improve.&rdquo;  For the quarter, revenue for JLR came in at 3.9 billion pounds with a pre-tax loss of 302 million pounds (EBIT margin -4.7 percent). The free cash outflow for the business was 664 million pounds, 484 million pounds of investment spending, and 501 million pounds of volume-related working capital outflow. &ldquo;This was significantly better than prior guidance for a 1 billion pounds free cash outflow, reflecting prioritised production of higher-margin products and cost controls to reduce the cash break-even point for the company,&rdquo; it stated.  The business has strong liquidity of 5.9 billion pounds as of September 30, 2021, including 3.8 billion pounds of cash and a 2 billion pounds undrawn revolving credit facility.  Tata Motors (Standalone+Joint Ops) Business Performance  The company&rsquo;s India business continues to perform strongly and witnessed an increase in both volume and average realisations for the quarter, however, the supply chain issues, and commodity inflation impacted the margins.  The domestic volumes were up 77 percent to 162.4K units. Commercial Vehicle (CV) volumes stood at 77.3K, up 102 percent y-o-y and the company&rsquo;s market share in CV space is 44.6 percent.  Passenger Vehicle (PV) volumes were 85.2K, up 59 percent YoY. The market share for the company in this segment strengthened further with decade-high quarterly sales.  Tata Motors' Electric Vehicles (EV) business witnessed strong momentum and registered the highest quarterly sales of 2,704 units.  Revenue of domestic business for the quarter increased 90.7 percent to Rs 18.4K crore and pre-tax loss before exceptional items came in at Rs 819 crore compared to a loss of Rs 1,166 crore in the same period last year.  CV EBITDA margin stood at 3.1 percent, which is a decline by 10 bps YoY mainly due to commodity inflation despite improvement in volumes and mix. PV business reported an EBITDA margin at 5.2 percent, an improvement of 360 bps YoY.  &ldquo;PBT improvement was mainly due to better volumes, improved product mix, offset by commodity inflation and fixed costs,&rdquo; the company said.  The business has a strong liquidity position as of 30th September 2021 amounting to Rs 6.8K crore.  Commenting on the quarter gone by, Girish Wagh, Executive Director Tata Motors Ltd said, &ldquo;At Tata Motors, we successfully ramped up production by prudently addressing supply-side challenges. During the quarter, we accelerated the sales momentum to increase market share in every segment of commercial vehicles, recorded a decade high sale in passenger vehicles, and delivered the highest ever quarterly sales in electric vehicles.&rdquo;  &amp;quot;Looking ahead, we expect the demand for commercial, passenger, and electric vehicles to remain strong even as concerns about the supply of semiconductors and high input costs continue. We are taking definitive actions in the near term to mitigate these effects,&amp;quot; Wagh added.  Commenting on the outlook for overall consolidated business, the company said, &ldquo;Demand remains strong for JLR and India PV while CV demand is improving gradually. Semiconductor issues and commodity inflation will continue to impact the near term and we are doing our best to manage them. The performance is expected to improve gradually starting in H2 as both the supply chain and the pandemic situation improves.&rdquo;  The stock closed at Rs 485.70 today, up Rs 2.0 from its previous day's close. The stock has seen a great run-up in the past one year and has risen 266 percent from its year-before levels. It has generated returns of 164 percent in this financial year, 65 percent in the past three months and 46 percent in the last one month.","Results, Tata Motors Limited","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/results/tata-motors-q2-results-|-net-loss-widens-yoy-to-rs-4442-crore_15709961.html

1223,2021-11-01 20:03:46+05:30,Tata Motors Ltd.,TATAMOTORS,Tata Motors fast running out of capacity but no new factory planned,"With slight improvement in the manufacturing capacity Tata Motors will move to producing half a million units, which would be the third highest in India after Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai","If the demand for Tata Motors&rsquo; cars and sports utility vehicles continue at the current pace, the company will have to soon look relook at its manufacturing footprint which is fast running out of capacity.  The Mumbai-based auto major clocked nearly 34,000 units in sales in October which is 85 percent of its rated capacity of 40,000 units a month. The company has been debottlenecking its factories to churn out more without making any significant investment towards it.  With slight improvement in the manufacturing capacity Tata Motors will move to producing half a million units, which would be the third highest in India after Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai.  Speaking to Moneycontrol post the announcement of September quarter results, PB Balaji, CFO, Tata Motors said, &ldquo;The capacity in our set up is ready to produce a minimum of 40,000 a month and we will be able to step it up as we go forward but we will take a hard look at the overall volume requirement and accordingly bolster the capacity. We will not stop growth for want of investments we will be proactive on that front.&rdquo;  Tata Motors makes passenger vehicles like Altroz, Nexon, Punch, Safari, Harrier, Tiago and Tigor at three locations, Pune, Ranjangaon (both in Maharashtra) and Sanand (Gujarat). According to the company, the debottlenecking exercise is good enough to manage monthly production for the rest of FY22.  &ldquo;We have a (annual) capacity of 480,000 units. We will keep a close watch and will press the button when necessary. Currently no green field project has been planned. We have enough capacity to expand at Sanand and Ranjangaon so we will decide what is right for us over the long term,&rdquo; Balaji added.  Tata Motors has nearly double its PV sales in little over a year. From around 18,000 units in August last year the company has managed to improve volumes because of multiple launches and continued push in new pockets of the domestic market. The company is the last remaining automotive to have kept the issue of supply shortage of semiconductors at bay even as each of its manufacturers have been hit severely.  The company claims that the average waiting period for its models is 6-8 weeks while the more popular ones have a waiting time of 9-10 weeks. Its electric vehicles have a waiting period of 6 months. The newly launched model Punch which has clocked sales of 8,000 units, has a waiting period of 3-4 weeks.  &ldquo;We are looking at the capacity every day because there is a lead time for creating capacity. This business used to have an available capacity of 25,000 (units a month) and we debottlenecked to 30,000 (units a month). And during the same time the powertrain mix has gone in favour of petrol from diesel. Petrol now is 75-80 percent. We have been debottlenecking quite consistently since last year and we will continue to that in foreseeable future,&rdquo; Balaji added.","Auto, Business, Tata Motors, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/tata-motors-fast-running-outcapacityno-new-factory-planned_15711281.html

1225,2021-11-02 10:40:44+05:30,Tata Motors Ltd.,TATAMOTORS,Tata Motors may not need a managing director after all,"The Mumbai-based manufacturer of luxury cars, sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and trucks is not looking for a replacement for Guenter Butschek, who stepped down from the MD&rsquo;s position by the end of June 2021 ","Tata Motors will keep the managing director&rsquo;s position vacant after it created a new structure wherein its three business units can operate independently under their chief executives.  The Mumbai-based manufacturer of luxury cars, sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and trucks is not looking for a replacement for Guenter Butschek, who stepped down from the MD&rsquo;s position by the end of June 2021 after the completion of his five-year term. Butschek has moved back to Germany but has agreed to be a consultant to Tata Motors until the end of this financial year.  Responding to a query from Moneycontrol, PB Balaji, chief financial officer of Tata Motors, said: &ldquo;Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), PV and CV are having their own CEOs for running the business quite independently. Wherever needed they come together. We have an established team which has been there for quite a while. So, at this point no such plans (of filling up the MD&rsquo;s position) are there. NRC (Nomination and Remuneration Committee) and the board will decide at the appropriate time when necessary.&rdquo;&nbsp;PV and CV are short for passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles.  While former Renault CEO Thierry Bollore was appointed as the chief executive officer of JLR as well as non-executive director of Tata Motors, Tata Motors veteran Girish Wagh was made the executive director in June 2021.  Wagh has been leading the commercial vehicle division of the company for several years. Shailesh Chandra was appointed president of the passenger vehicle business unit of which the burgeoning unit of electric vehicles is a part. Chandra, as the unit&rsquo;s CEO, took over from Mayank Pareek, who retired from that position in early 2020. Bollore, Wagh and Chandra, who are part of the executive committee, report to N Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Motors.&nbsp;  In February, Tata Motors announced the appointment of Marc Llistosella as the new CEO and MD of the company. Llistosella, who has extensive experience working in India through Daimler India Commercial Vehicles, where he was the head of operations, was set to take over from July 1, 2021.  However, a month later Tata Motors said Llistosella would not join since he is not able to relocate to India because of personal reasons. The abrupt and unexplained exit of Llistosella even before taking charge led to a leadership vacuum within the company which was emerging from the shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The last time Tata Motors faced such a situation was in 2014 when its former MD Karl Slym committed suicide, creating a void at the highest level for two years before head hunters at the Mumbai-based Tata Group zeroed in on Butschek.  Coincidently, Llistosella spent as many years (25 years) with the truck and car giant Daimler as did Butschek, who will be relocating to Germany.  Butschek&rsquo;s five-year term at Tata Motors ended on February 15, 2021, but he agreed to stay on for a few months at the request of the company&rsquo;s board. After the retirement of Prakash Telang in June&nbsp;2012, no Indian has led Tata Motors in the position of MD and CEO.","Auto, Business, Tata Motors, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/tata-motors-may-not-needmanaging-director-after-all_15714301.html

1232,2021-11-03 07:50:36+05:30,Eicher Motors Ltd.,EICHERMOT, Eicher Motors Q2FY22 Results Preview | Subdued RE volumes to overshadow strong performance by VECV...,Experts expect Eicher Motors&rsquo; revenues to decline between 5 percent and 7 percent on a yearly basis and profits are expected to dip by 7-9 percent.,"Eicher Motors Ltd, the maker of iconic Royal Enfield (RE) motorcycle, commercial vehicles and tractors, is coming out with its results on November 3 for the quarter ended September 21.  Experts expect its revenues to decline between 5 percent and 7 percent on a yearly basis and profits are expected to dip by 7-9 percent.  The company had reported net sales of Rs 2,134 crore and a PAT of Rs 343 crore in the second quarter of the previous financial year. In the previous quarter of this financial year, the net sales for the company stood at Rs 1,974 crore with a profit after tax of Rs 237 crore.  What expectations do brokerages have?  A report from Emkay Research expects volumes to fall 17 percent Year-Over-Year (YoY) with average realisations improving by 15 percent owing to price hikes and product mix in terms of a higher share of 350 CC+ motorcycles.  It expects net sales to decline 4.1 percent on an annualised basis to Rs 2,046 crore with EBITDA coming in at Rs 372 crore which is a decline of 21 percent from 2020&rsquo;s EBITDA of Rs 471 crore. EBITDA margins are expected to contract 387 bps to 18.2 percent due to lower scale and delays in pass-through of commodity inflation.  On a quarterly basis, revenues are expected to improve 3.6 percent with EBITDA clocking a rise of 2.7 percent on a Quarter on quarter&nbsp;(QoQ) basis. EBITDA margins are expected to remain flat sequentially and while PAT is looking to improve by 28 percent from last quarter.  The brokerage expects a decline of 11.8 percent in net profit at Rs 303 crore. It says,&amp;quot;Share of profits from Volvo-Eicher Commercial Vehicles (VECV) JV may rise to Rs 26 crore from a loss of Rs 4 crore last year, owing to notably high volumes (85 percent).&rdquo;  ICICI Securities (Isec) expects a soft performance from the company in this quarter on flattish QoQ volumes of RE at 1.23 lakh units in this quarter. Consolidated net sales are expected at Rs 1,967 crore declining 7 percent from last year and up 1.2 percent from the previous quarter. It expects the realisations for the company to improve about 4.5 percent q-o-q with blended realisations of Rs 1.59 lakh/unit due to higher share of &amp;amp;gt;350 cc motorcycles within the overall mix.  An EBITDA of Rs 355 crore is expected for the quarter with EBITDA margin of 17.9 percent, declining 50 bps on a QoQ basis. The decline in margins is driven by higher commodity prices and absence of operating leverage.  The PAT is expected to come in at Rs 317 crore, down 8 percent on a yearly basis but up 34 percent on a quarterly basis. The brokerage says, &ldquo;We expect VECV profit share at Rs 47.4 crore (VECV volumes up 160 percent QoQ to 15,134 units)&rdquo;.  Kotak Institutional Equities expect net sales to come down 5.8 percent YoY to Rs 2,011. However, it is a growth of 1.8 percent over the previous quarter.  The brokerage says, &ldquo;We expect Royal Enfield revenues to decline 7 percent YoY in this quarter led by 18 percent YoY decline in volumes, partly offset by 14 percent YoY increase in ASPs due to richer model mix and price increases taken over the past few quarters.&rdquo;  EBITDA is expected to contract by 17.8 percent on a yearly basis to Rs 387 crore in this quarter with EBITDA margins squeezing by 283 bps to 19.3 percent and improving by 86 bps on a sequential basis.  The brokerage expects VECV to report an EBITDA margin of 6 percent in this quarter compared to 1.1 percent in the previous quarter of this year due to operating leverage benefits.  The stock closed at Rs 2,542.45 on November 2, down Rs 17.55 from its previous close. The stock is up 25 percent over the past year but flat in this financial year. The stock is down 2 percent over the past 3 months and down 8 percent over the past one year.","Eicher Motors Limited, Results","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/gaurav-sharma-18801/', 'name': 'Gaurav Sharma'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/results/eicher-motors-q2fy22-results-preview-|-subdued-re-volumes-to-overshadow-strong-performance-by-vecv-business_15719681.html

1234,2021-11-03 13:03:56+05:30,Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.,MARUTI,Car buyers cancel bookings as auto companies delay Diwali deadline,"While booking cancellations are normal in the automotive retail business, the level of cancellations this year is unusually high, say dealers.","Car buyers have started to cancel bookings which they made in anticipation that they would be able to take deliveries during the festive days as manufacturers continue to struggle to align supplies with demand.  Automotive dealers have seen a spike in the number of booking cancellations in the run up to Diwali in the past few weeks. While booking cancellations are normal in the automotive retail business, the level of cancellations this year is unusually high, say dealers.  &ldquo;Enquiry levels and demand is very strong for passenger vehicles but along with that cancellations are also increasing because we are not able to commit the delivery date. People wait for the auspicious occasion and when deliveries don&rsquo;t happen on those dates, they tend to cancel rather than extend the period,&rdquo; Vinkesh Gulati, President, Federation of Automobile Dealer Association (FADA) speaking to Moneycontrol.  With stock levels with dealers hitting all-time low of just 15-20 days as against 35-40 days, manufacturers are struggling to supply as required because of shortage in availability of semiconductors. This has led the industry to achieve production of only half of the required numbers in October. On November 2 FADA claimed that the current festive period is the worst in a decade despite the passenger vehicle industry sitting on pending orders of more than 350,000 units.  &ldquo;Cancellations have doubled than normal. We normally have 5-10 percent cancellations but now it's 20-25 percent. If a person does not get a vehicle in four months, his interest in the purchase wanes, his requirement for investment in any other field gets fired up. Thus, the money kept for buying a car gets more likely to be spent elsewhere since it is lying unused,&rdquo; Gulati added.  Car market leader Maruti Suzuki said that its pending bookings have crossed 250,000 units but admitted that cancellations have been slightly higher than usual. The Delhi-based company slashed output by 40 percent in October and managed to sell just 66 percent of its typical monthly sales total.  Shashank Srivastava, executive director, Maruti Suzuki India said, &ldquo;Cancellations are slightly above the long-term average but not so different that I will call it unusual. Cancellations are roughly similar to last year&rsquo;s level in week three and week four of October. Week three was a little higher than last year. Cancellations are 4.6-5 percent higher than last year.&rdquo;  New models like the MG Astor, Volkswagen Taigun and Tata Punch have a waiting period of three months to four months. Other new, in-demand models like the Mahindra XUV700 have a waiting period of nine months. Other regular models like the Hyundai Creta, Kia Seltos and Maruti Suzuki Ertiga (CNG) have a waiting period of anywhere between four to six months.  &ldquo;There are lots of buyers who just go for an impromptu purchase and those are not the ones who wait for 3 or six months for deliveries. These customers buy a vehicle in 1-2 visits and finalise a deal within a week. And this happens every festive season and these are the customers that we have lost,&rdquo; Gulati added.  Talking to the media in the Q2FY22 earnings call PB Balaji CFO, Tata Motors, said, &ldquo;We do not like the fact that we are making the customer wait for so much for the delivery. We have not seen any cancellation of bookings so far and demand remains robust for Tata Motors.&rdquo; ","Auto, Business, FADA, Maruti Suzuki, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/car-buyers-cancel-bookings-as-auto-companies-delay-diwali-deadline_15725241.html

Refining throughput (+5% QoQ) and marketing sales volume (+3% QoQ) were in line with our estimates - on the back of demand recovery post the second COVID wave. BPCL remains confident of achieving 100% utilisation of its refining nameplate capacity in FY22. Technical debottlenecking at the company&rsquo;s PDPP plant in Kochi is underway and management expects the three units to contribute significantly from 4QFY22. Management expects the GRM to improve by USD1/bbl even if margins normalise from hereon. Outlook A further improvement in the company&rsquo;s GRMs and marketing margin returning to normalised levels could create the potential for an upside to our call. On the other hand, any delay in the privatisation procedure owing to further lockdowns or delay in the opening up of international borders poses a downside risk to our call.

The company is hoping for a softening of commodity prices, which also move cycles, having &amp;quot;sort of reached the peak&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;Material cost is an important cost in the overall cost structure for any OEM (original equipment manufacturer). Normally, 70-75 per cent of the total cost of an OEM is material cost.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;In the second quarter, our material cost to net sales ratio had gone up to a very high figure of 80.5 per cent. This is unprecedented,&rdquo; Maruti Suzuki India Senior Executive Director (Marketing and Sales) Shashank Srivastava told PTI.  When asked if the company will hike prices of its vehicles, especially around the new year as is usually done, he said, &amp;quot;We have to carefully monitor the situation because we haven&rsquo;t passed on even the past increases of commodity prices into our (vehicle) price hikes.&rdquo;  Srivastava added that the company has taken a price hike of about 1.9 per cent at the beginning of September but &amp;quot;we have to carefully watch the direction of the commodity price movement in the future&rdquo;.  He further said the peak of commodity prices was in Q1 of the ongoing fiscal but the effect of it comes to the OEMs like Maruti Suzuki with a lag of one quarter.  &amp;quot;So, the effect of that peak had come to us in the second quarter,&rdquo; he said, adding that the commodity prices have been increasing dramatically in the past one year.  He said, &amp;quot;Starting from May 2020, almost all commodities that are related to automobile production have increased.&rdquo;  Steel, which was Rs 38 per kg, went up to about Rs 72 per kg, although it has come down a little bit.  Copper, which was at $5,200 per tonnes, also went up to $10,400 per tonnes, he added.  Besides, the prices of other precious metals like palladium, platinum and rhodium have also gone up by up to almost two-three times.  &amp;quot;It does show that there has been a huge, unprecedented increase in commodity prices and still continue to be high, although in the precious metal, there have been some softening in the last couple of weeks,&rdquo; Srivastava said.  He expressed hope that in the next few quarters, there will be less pressure compared to the current level.  &amp;quot;The consensus seems to be that we have sort of reached the peak as far as commodity prices are concerned because commodity prices also move in cycles.&amp;quot;","Auto, Business, Maruti Suzuki India, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/39maruti-suzuki-india-keeping-close-watchcommodities39-price-movement-to-fix-vehicle-prices39_15735741.html

The experts are expecting it to report an annualised growth of about 6-8&nbsp;percent in consolidated revenues while the margins are expected to contract on the back of higher agri input prices due to which profit after tax (PAT) is expected to decline by about 12-14&nbsp;percent on a y-o-y basis.  The company had reported consolidated revenues of Rs 3,419 crore during the same period last year with PAT coming in at Rs 498 crore. During the first quarter of this financial year, the revenues stood at Rs 3,404 crore and PAT at Rs 390 crore.  Phillip Capital expects the company&rsquo;s revenues to witness an increase of 8.7&nbsp;percent on a y-o-y basis to Rs 3,716 crore. The brokerage expects &ldquo;mid-single-digit&nbsp;volume growth despite high base owing to availability of entire range, focus on Milk biscuits segment and increase in distribution network&rdquo;.  Gross margins are expected to be impacted by about 233 bps y-o-y to 39.1&nbsp;percent owing to inferior SKU and brand mix while EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margin is expected at 17.1&nbsp;percent, down 306 bps from 20.1&nbsp;percent reported in the same period last year. On a sequential basis, the EBITDA margins are seen improving marginally by 55 bps.  The brokerage highlights that the EBITDA margins are getting knocked down &ldquo;due to higher freight costs, negative operating leverage and increased competitive intensity&rdquo;.  The muted operating performance of the company will result in a 9.5&nbsp;percent y-o-y decline in PAT to Rs 451 crore, says the brokerage.  Axis Securities expects a 6.2&nbsp;percent increase in revenues on an annualised basis to Rs 3,630 crore. The volume growth on a y-o-y basis in this quarter is expected to be 4&nbsp;percent compared to a volume growth of 9&nbsp;percent witnessed in the same period of last financial year.  EBITDA for the company is expected at Rs 604 crore, down by around 11&nbsp;percent from Rs 675 crore in the previous year. On a q-o-q basis, EBITDA is seen improving by 9&nbsp;percent from Rs 554 crore.  As per the brokerage, &ldquo;the gross margins are expected to contract by 250 bps y-o-y amid rise in costs for agri-commodities and packaging costs.&rdquo; This will have an adverse impact on the EBITDA margins as well which are expected to decline by 312 bps to 16.6&nbsp;percent.  It expects the company to report a PAT of Rs 430 crore, down 13.2&nbsp;percent on a y-o-y basis but up 11.1&nbsp;percent on a sequential basis.  It highlights the things that need to be monitored&nbsp;--&nbsp;demand environment, raw material cost outlook,&nbsp;market share trends and update on Inter Corporate Deposits (ICDs).  Just like Axis Securities, Motilal Oswal expects volume growth of 4&nbsp;percent in this quarter compared to 9&nbsp;percent volume growth witnessed in the same period last year. However, it expects a 2&nbsp;percent annualised growth in revenues to Rs 3,490 crore in this quarter.  The brokerage expects an EBITDA of Rs 580 crore which is a decline of 13.8&nbsp;percent from last year and an EBITDA margin of 16.7&nbsp;percent in this quarter.  The brokerage says that the cost-saving initiatives undertaken by the company helped reduce the impact of higher agri prices.  The company is expected to report a PAT of Rs 430 crore, down 13.9&nbsp;percent over last year. Raw material cost outlook and update on ICDs will be the key things to watch out for, the brokerage says.  Kotak Institutional Equities predicts the revenues to rise by 6.1&nbsp;percent on a y-o-y basis to Rs 3,627 crore. It expects 3.5&nbsp;percent y-o-y domestic volume growth in biscuits and 2.5&nbsp;percent growth in contribution from price-mix.  The brokerage adds, &ldquo;We expect consolidated gross margin to remain under pressure, declining 360 bps y-o-y. Price increases should support marginal q-o-q improvement in gross margin.&rdquo; It expects an EBITDA of Rs 613 crore, down 9.2&nbsp;percent from last year which will result in 285 bps y-o-y decline in EBITDA margins to 16.9&nbsp;percent. Consequently, PAT is expected to decline 14.2&nbsp;percent y-o-y to Rs 428 crore in this quarter.  The stock closed at Rs 3,652.6 on November 5, up Rs 22.75 from its previous close.

However, margins are expected to be impacted by the raw material headwinds.","Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra, the flagship automotive company of the Mahindra Group, may report a 12 percent drop in profit as the sector endures challenges such as a worldwide shortage of semiconductors and a steep rise in commodity prices, analysts said. Margins are expected to be impacted by raw material headwinds, which will result in profit after tax declining by 11-12 percent from a year earlier. Revenue is expected to increase by 7-8 percent year-on-year, aided by an about 3 percent increase in both volumes and realisations. The maker of utility vehicles and tractors is set to declare its results for the quarter ended September on November 9. The company reported standalone PAT of Rs 162 crore (after exceptional items of Rs 1,150 crore) in the quarter ended September 2020.&nbsp;The company&rsquo;s standalone revenue was&nbsp;Rs 11,590 crore during the same period last year.

The brokerage expects a surge of 123 percent in dividend income from Tech Mahindra and M&amp;amp;amp;M Financial Services, resulting in other income of Rs 860 crore for the quarter. This will result in PAT increasing by 13.7 percent to Rs 1,491 crore from Rs 1,311 crore (before exceptional items) last year and by about 60 percent from Rs 934 crore (before exceptional items) in the preceding quarter. Sharekhan expects a 7.6 percent y-o-y increase in revenue to Rs 12,471 crore. The growth will be &ldquo;aided by 14 percent increase in automotive revenue and flat growth in tractor revenue. Automotive realisation is expected to improve by 4 percent y-o-y, while tractor realisation is expected to improve by 5.5 percent y-o-y,&rdquo; it said. The EBITDA margin is expected to decline to 13.3 percent in Q2, driven by an inferior product mix and a rise in raw material prices, according to Sharekhan. It said the company will likely report PAT of Rs 915 crore in the quarter. Yes Securities expects the company&rsquo;s revenue to increase 7.7 percent on an annualised basis to Rs 12,604 crore (7.1 percent q-o-q). It estimates a 5 percent y-o-y increase in both volumes and realisations for the quarter. It said EBITDA may decline 18.5 percent to Rs 1,676 crore. &ldquo;We expect EBITDA margins at 13.3 percent to be impacted due to weak mix (tractor mix at 47 percent v/s 51 percent y-o-y) and higher RM,&rdquo; the brokerage said. PAT may decline to Rs 942 crore from Rs 1,311 crore last year. Motilal Oswal expects a 3 percent y-o-y increase in volumes to 190,600 units in the quarter against 185,270 units a year earlier. It said net realisations may increase 3 percent to Rs 6,40,578/unit from Rs 6,21,920/unit last year. &ldquo;SUVs and pickups see a good recovery in demand, but were restricted by supply-chain constraints,&rdquo; it said. This rise in volumes and realisations could result in revenue rising 6 percent to Rs 12,209 crore. However, the brokerage said higher commodity prices may increase raw material costs as a percentage of sales to 71.5 percent from 66.8 percent in the same quarter last year. This will contract the EBITDA margin to 12.8 percent. PAT is expected at Rs 1,171 crore. The Mahindra stock declined 1.6 percent to Rs 859.5 at the close on the BSE on November 8. The shares have advanced 40 percent during the past year.","Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M), Results","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/gaurav-sharma-18801/', 'name': 'Gaurav Sharma'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/results/mahindramahindra-q2fy22-results-preview-â-revenues-to-increase-7-8pat-to-decline-11-12_15740861.html

This is the second time that the Mumbai-based company is talking about bringing an investor on board for its EV business. In August 2020 the then managing director of the company, Pawan Goenka claimed that several suitors were in talks with M&amp;amp;amp;M and some of them had even completed the due diligence process.  M&amp;amp;amp;M was looking for $100 million (Rs 750 crore) in Mahindra Electric Mobility (MEML), one of the first companies formed in India that engaged purely in electric vehicles. But in March 2021, M&amp;amp;amp;M merged the subsidiary MEML into itself to consolidate development, sourcing and manufacturing of EVs after it could not finalise a partner for the deal.  In a post earnings conference call Anish Shah, Managing Director, M&amp;amp;amp;M said, &ldquo;We are now open to looking at funding coming in from outside that will help us grow much faster. But it is not just for capital but also for any expertise that investors may bring in. In recent times we have seen expertise coming from private equity or other strategic partners.&rdquo;  In 2021 three companies &ndash; Tata Motors, Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Company &ndash; formed separate subsidiaries to house their EV business unit. While Tata Motors, the current market leader in the passenger, four-wheeler EV segment, has already brought a couple of investors on board, Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Company are also understood to be either open on getting investors or are in talks with investors.  M&amp;amp;amp;M has committed investments of Rs 3,000 crore over a three-year cycle for the EV vertical. This includes development of electric SUVs, electric quadricycle and electric small and light commercial vehicles. In all, the company is eyeing 16 EV launches in seven years.  &ldquo;We have a fairly good position to get EV products to the market which we believe are very strong products and once we do that, we will have a greater momentum on the EV side. We are open to looking at investments, we just want to make sure we get to market with a great set of products that (could) give us the market leadership once again. We are open to all options because electric is going to be big and therefore, we are not closing any options,&rdquo; Shah added.  M&amp;amp;amp;M does not have any electric passenger four-wheeler in continuous production though it was one of the first to get into this space post the acquisition of Reva Electric Car Company. Tata Motors, which entered the EV space a few years ago has a leadership position with a share of 70 percent. M&amp;amp;amp;M, however, claims a more than 60 percent share of the electric three-wheeler segment.","Auto, Business, Mahindra, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/mahindramahindra-âopenâ-to-funding-for-electric-vehicle-business-once-again_15745661.html

Tata Motors and Mahindra are estimated to have over 300,000 pending orders.","Auto companies hamstrung by the continuing semiconductor shortage are taking countermeasures such as bringing down chip usage per vehicle or offering cars with fewer chip-dependent features.  Tata Motors and Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra (M&amp;amp;amp;M) have undertaken these measures in a desperate effort to improve vehicle supplies and bring down the waiting period, which, in certain cases, is at a staggering 12 months. Both companies are estimated to be sitting on over 300,00 pending orders.  Tatas optimise chip usage  Tata Motors, India&rsquo;s third-largest carmaker, has dramatically cut the number of chips used per vehicle. The maker of Safari SUVs has halved the number of chips used in one specific component that powers the vehicle. While Tata Motors officials did not identify the vehicle model, they said that the company was working on optimisation of chips to tide over the supply crisis.  In a post-earnings conference call, Shailesh Chandra, President (Passenger Vehicle Business Unit), Tata Motors, said, &ldquo;In one component we were able to successfully bring down the number of semiconductors that we were using to half. We have been looking to convert application-specific chips to standard chips and we have gone in for optimisation of chips, which is about reducing usage of chips and validating them in a very short period.&rdquo;  Cross-leveraging JLR expertise  Tata Motors has been working alongside its British brands Jaguar and Land Rover to cross-leverage their expertise for the future generation of electric and electronic architecture. Electric vehicles need many more chips than fossil-fuel powered vehicles.  &ldquo;We have taken multiple initiatives as part of our semiconductor strategy in light of demand for electric vehicles. We have successfully brought down the use of chips by going with an all-in-one strategy. Many times the components have been different and we have been able to optimise the number of semiconductors and exposure to semiconductor suppliers,&rdquo; Chandra added.  Tata Motors has been less impacted by the semiconductor shortage compared to its peers Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai and M&amp;amp;amp;M, who have had to resort to significant production cuts due to the chip shortage over the last few weeks.  M&amp;amp;amp;M reduces chip usage  To get around the shortage, M&amp;amp;amp;M has created step-down variants of the in-demand XUV700 SUV, which lack some features that customers had opted for. For instance, the chip-dependent wireless mobile charging feature has been removed by the company in the flagship SUV before being offered to the customer.  Speaking to Moneycontrol, Rajesh Jejurikar, Executive Director (Automotive and Farm Equipment Sectors), M&amp;amp;amp;M, said, &ldquo;There are specific shortages of semiconductors that go into high-end products. We may adapt some of our variant offerings in XUV700 to give customers the option of giving up some features on a lower-price setoff, depending on the kind of shortages.&rdquo;  Jejurikar added, &ldquo;We are not forcing the customer to buy the new variant. It is completely up to them to choose.&rdquo; The fully loaded variant of the XUV700 comes with 170 chips, some of which power the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS).  With the XUV700 getting cumulative bookings of 70,000 units, M&amp;amp;amp;M claims that consumer response for the SUV has made it the company&rsquo;s best product rollout to date. The Mumbai-based company has pending orders of 160,000 units, including bookings for the XUV700. M&amp;amp;amp;M added that it had lost total production of 32,000 vehicles during the September quarter due to the chip shortage.","Auto, Business, Mahindra, Tata Motors, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/tata-motors-mahindramahindra-dodge-chip-shortageinnovation_15749061.html

Margins were weak, resulting in EBITDA/PAT being 11-15% below expectations. EBITDA declined 17% to Rs5.6bn and PAT declined 23% on high comparables. Market share gains were stronger than FY21. Management appears fairly optimistic about growth, as rural reach expansion is expected to help sustain future growth, along with increased aggression in non-biscuit portfolio amid the pick-up in on-the-go consumption. Input inflation is high and may inch up further in Q3. However, additional price hikes of ~6% to be effected by Q4 and cost efficiencies should reduce the margin impact and drive a sequential margin recovery. We estimate FY22/23/24 margins at 16.1%/17.1%/17.5%. We cut FY22E EPS by 10% and FY23-24E EPS by 4-5%. The growth outlook seems to be improving, with margins likely to recover qoq.

On a quarterly basis, profit may improve by 25-30 percent while revenue could increase by about 13 percent, they said.  The country&rsquo;s largest private sector steel manufacturer is scheduled to declare its results for the second quarter of FY22 on November 11.  The Tata Group company reported profit after tax of Rs 1,546 crore in the corresponding quarter last year and consolidated revenue of Rs 37,154 crore. In the quarter ended June, PAT stood at Rs 8,907 crore and revenue was Rs 53,372 crore.  Brokerage views  Steel realisation is expected to increase 2 percent q-o-q and 71 percent y-o-y, led by higher steel prices in the domestic market, sequential increase in exports and a price reset in contracted volumes, Kotak Institutional Equities said.  Volumes are expected to rise 18 percent q-o-q to 4.5 million tonnes on the easing of pandemic restrictions. However, on a yearly basis, this 8 percent lower on a high base and a price-led pushback.  The brokerage expects revenue of Rs 60,049 crore for the quarter, a 62 percent increase y-o-y and 12.5 percent increase on a sequential basis.  EBITDA/tonne for the company&rsquo;s India operations would decline 2 percent q-o-q to Rs 33,209, up 182 percent y-o-y, on higher coking coal costs offset by higher prices, the brokerage added.  &ldquo;We estimate Europe EBITDA/tonne at $204/tonne ($89/tonne in 1QFY22 -$27/tonne in 2QFY21) primarily led by higher steel prices,&rdquo; Kotak said.  EBITDA at Bhushan Steel, which Tata Steel acquired through the insolvency resolution route in 2018, is estimated to decline 5 percent q-o-q to Rs 2,900 crore due to higher costs. However, on a yearly basis, this would increase 165 percent.  This will result in a consolidated PAT of Rs 11,976 crore for the quarter, a y-o-y increase of 675 percent and a sequential increase of 35 percent.  ICICI Securities expects Tata Steel to record revenue of Rs 60,254 crore for the quarter, a rise of 62 percent from a year earlier and a 13 percent increase from the previous quarter.  Standalone steel sales volume are expected at 3.5 million tonnes, European steel sales are likely to come in at 2.2 million tonnes, and Bhushan Steel is expected to report sales volumes of 1.1 million tonnes, according to the brokerage.  For the quarter, the company&rsquo;s standalone EBITDA/tonne is likely at Rs 36,500 compared with Rs 35,558 in the preceding quarter and Rs 12,861 in the same period last year.  &ldquo;Consolidated EBITDA margins are likely to come in at 33.5 percent compared to 30.2 percent in the previous quarter,&rdquo; the brokerage said.  It works out an annualised increase of 647 percent in PAT to Rs 12,206 crore for the quarter, up 25 percent from the preceding quarter.  Prabhudas Liladhar expects a 62 percent y-o-y rise in revenue to Rs 60,151 crore. On a quarterly basis, the revenue increase is expected to be 12.7 percent.  Tata Steel Europe is expected to report EBITDA/tonne of $250, higher by 180 percent on a q-o-q basis due to improvement in spreads, the brokerage said.  &ldquo;Owing to better performance in domestic and overseas operations, we expect consolidated EBITDA to grow sharply by 26 percent q-o-q to Rs 20,330 crore,&rdquo; it said. PAT is expected to grow 40 percent q-o-q to Rs 12,722 crore.  Motilal Oswal expects a 13.7 percent q-o-q rise in consolidated revenue to Rs 60,673 crore and PAT to increase 14.4 percent on a sequential basis to Rs 10,398 crore.

On a quarterly basis, PAT at India&rsquo;s largest oil exploration company is expected to grow by 40 percent and revenue may improve by 12 percent, they said.  State-owned ONGC is scheduled to announce its results for the July-September quarter on November 12.

Margins are likely to be affected going ahead due to inflation in raw material prices and operating deleverage.,"Hero Motocorp is expected to report a dip of about 30&nbsp;percent in standalone Profit after Tax (PAT) for the quarter ended September 30, 2021, compared to last year while standalone revenues could contract 15&nbsp;percent due to a significant decline in volumes even though there was improvement in the average selling price (ASP), said the analysts.  On a quarterly basis, the net profit is expected to increase by about 80&nbsp;percent and revenues are likely to grow nearly 45&nbsp;percent, they said.  India&rsquo;s largest two-wheeler manufacturer is scheduled to declare its results for July-September quarter for FY22 on November 12.  The company had reported standalone profit after tax of Rs 953 crore in the corresponding quarter last year on revenues of Rs 9,367 crore. In the first quarter of this financial year, the company had recorded a PAT of Rs 365 crore on revenues of Rs 5,487 crore.  Views from the Street  &ldquo;Revenues are expected to decline on lower volumes (-20% YoY) but realization is likely to be higher by 6%, owing to price hikes&rdquo;, said Emkay Research.  The brokerage expects the company to report a decline of 15.7% y-o-y and an increase of 44% q-o-q in revenues to Rs 7,896 crore for the quarter.  This will result in a 32% y-o-y decline in EBITDA which is expected at Rs 872 crore compared to Rs 1,286 crore in the corresponding period last year. On a q-o-q basis, EBITDA is likely to improve by 69% from Rs 515 crore reported in the previous quarter.  &ldquo;EBITDA margin may contract due to lower scale and delays in the pass-through of commodity inflation&rdquo;, said Emkay. It estimates the EBITDA margin of 11% for the quarter declining from 13.7% last year and improving from 9.4% in the preceding quarter.  This works out to a PAT of Rs 633 crore for the quarter which is decline of 33.6% y-o-y and an increase of 73% q-o-q.  &ldquo;Demand recovery was slower than expected after the lifting of COVID-related lockdown and margins are likely to be impacted due to raw material inflation and operating deleverage&rdquo;, said Motilal Oswal on the performance of the company. However, price hikes and cost cutting may dilute the impact.  It expects the volumes for the quarter to decline 20.7% from 18.15 lakh units to 14.4 lakh units. On a sequential basis, the volumes are expected to grow smartly by 40% from 10.2 Lakh units.  Realizations are expected to grow 7.4% y-o-y to Rs 55,434 from Rs 51,620. Realizations in the previous quarter stood at Rs 53,559.  The brokerage expects the revenues of Rs 7,975 crore for the quarter, down 15% y-o-y and up 45% q-o-q.  This will result in a 27% y-o-y decline in EBITDA to Rs 935 crore from Rs 1,286 crore. On a q-o-q basis, EBITDA is to improve 82% from Rs 515 crore. Consequently, EBITDA margins may decline from 13.7% last year to 11.7% in this quarter. The company had reported EBITDA margins of 9.4% in the previous quarter.  PAT for the quarter is expected at Rs 684 crore, down 28% y-o-y and up 87% q-o-q.  &ldquo;We expect revenues to decline by 15% y-o-y in 2QFY22 led by 20% y-o-y decline in volumes and 6% y-o-y increase in ASPs&rdquo;, said Kotak Institutional Equities.  It expects the company to report revenues of Rs 7,936 crore for the quarter, down 15.3% y-o-y and up 44.6% q-o-q.  EBITDA margin is likely to increase by 200 bps q-o-q led by operating leverage benefits. &ldquo;Gross margin will likely decline by 100 bps on a qoq basis as raw material cost pressures will get partly offset by price increases and LEAP savings&rdquo;, said Kotak.  It expects EBITDA margins to come in at 11.4% resulting in a PAT of Rs 668 crore for the quarter, down 30% y-o-y and up 83% q-o-q.

Passenger vehicles (PV) comprising cars, SUVs and vans saw 27 percent fall in wholesale dispatches to dealers to 226,353 units as against the same period last year. Data of Tata Motors, BMW, Mercedes, Audi and Jaguar Land Rover are not included in the sales total. Withdrawal by Ford from the domestic market also impacted sales.  The fall is majorly attributed to the inability of companies to match demand with supplies because of the crunch in availability of chips. The fall comes on the back of the industry sitting on pending orders of more than 550,000 units, as claimed by companies.  Maruti Suzuki led the fall during October followed by Hyundai, Kia, Renault and Honda. Tata Motors and Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra managed to clock growth during the same month in production and sales volumes. With companies unable to deliver booked models within the usual time period, waiting periods have stretched to a year in some cases.  While the chip shortage has hit two-wheelers manufacturers too, retail demand has been a bigger worry for the manufacturers. October reported 25 percent decline in wholesale two-wheeler dispatches to dealers to 1.80 million units as against the same month last year.  Rural demand which was robust in 2020 due to bumper crop income was poor in 2021 due to the after effects of the state-wise lockdowns earlier this year. High petrol prices and the continuous increase in product prices also deterred buyers significantly. Analysts say the festive season of 2021 has been the worst in several years for the segment.  Market leader Hero MotoCorp led the sales fall during October followed by Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India, Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Company.  While three-wheeler volumes grew by 19 percent to 31,774 units during October compared to the same month last year, sales data of commercial vehicles was not made available by SIAM.  Rajesh Menon, Director General, SIAM said &ldquo;Manufacturers were banking on the festive season to recover from the severe drop in sales they have faced in the early part of financial year 2021-22. However, shortage of semiconductors and steep hike in raw material cost have been a major spoilsport for the industry.&rdquo;  According to automakers there has been a slight improvement in supplies of semiconductors in the past few days and the trend is expected to continue in the coming months.

The state-owned oil and gas exploration and production company reported a consolidated profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 18,749 crore increasing 3.3x/234% from a PAT of Rs 5,675 crore in the corresponding quarter last year and higher by 174% from a PAT of Rs 6,847 crore in the preceding quarter.  The consolidated revenues at Rs 1,22,029 crore climbed up 46% from Rs 83,619 crore recorded in the corresponding quarter last year. On a sequential basis, consolidated revenues are up 13% from Rs. 1,08,136 crore reported in the previous quarter.  &ldquo;During the quarter, the company has decided to opt for lower tax regime u/s 115BAA of the Income Tax Act, 1961, with effect from FY 2020-21. Accordingly, the company has recognized provision for tax expenses and re-measured its net deferred tax liabilities&rdquo;, said the company.  The net impact due to availing the option has resulted in decrease in deferred tax liability by Rs 8,541 crore and decrease in current tax liability by Rs 1,304 crore. This tax write back of Rs 7,195 crore has inflated the bottom line in this quarter.  The company benefitted from higher crude realizations and higher prices of value added products.  Crude and Gas Realizations  The company&rsquo;s nominated crude realizations improved 68% y-o-y from Rs 3,078/bbl to Rs 5,139/bbl (USD 69.36 in Q2FY22 vs USD 41.38 in Q2FY21).

However, the gas realizations for the company declined 25% y-o-y from USD 2.39/mmbtu to USD 1.79/mmbtu.  Crude and Gas Production  The production of both crude and gas for the company declined during the quarter due to COVID-related restrictions in many parts of the country.  The company&rsquo;s own crude oil production was down 3% y-o-y to 4.68 million metric tonne (MMT) while its JV produced 4.3% lower volume at 0.56 MMT in this quarter. Condensate production declined 17% y-o-y to 0.24 MMT.  Total gas production during the quarter (ONGC+JVs) was down 7% y-o-y from 5.88 billion cubic meters in the previous year (BCM) to 5.47 BCM in this quarter. Production of value added products also declined 4.7% from 826 kilo tonne (Kt) last year to 787 Kt in this quarter.  &ldquo;The production of crude oil and gas has declined during current year mainly due to restrictive conditions created by cyclone Tauktae and due to Covid impact&rdquo;, the company said.  Operating Margins &nbsp;  The increase in Brent Crude prices helped the operating margins of the company to improve from 32.8% last year to 48.2% in this quarter.  Dividend  ONGC has approved interim dividend of 110%, i.e. Rs 5.50 on each equity share of Rs 5. The total payout on this account will be Rs 6,919 Crore.

TCPL has signed a definitive agreement to acquire 100 per cent equity shares of TSFL, a deal which will help the Tata group FMCG arm to enter into the 'Ready to Eat' category, said a joint statement.  This move is consistent with TCPL&rsquo;s strategic intent to expand into value-added categories, it said, adding the acquisition will enable TCPL to expand its product portfolio and enter the RTE segment.  TSFL, under the brand name Tata Q, offers a range of differentiated products manufactured using MATS technology in India.  It had commenced operations in 2019 and became the second-largest player in the RTE market.  TSFL also has a manufacturing facility in Sri City, Andhra Pradesh.  TCPL expects the RTE category to grow at a significant pace, benefitting from demographic tailwinds such as urbanisation and high disposable income nuclear families looking for convenience, nutrition and hygienic food on the go.  The category is already large and growing strongly in the international markets that TCPL already operates in Tata Consumer Products will leverage its existing domestic and international distribution and focus on operational excellence to maximise value, said TCPL.  Moreover, TSFL is using MATS technology, which will also enable TCPL to create a strong pipeline of value-added products in other parts of the foods business.  Microwave-assisted thermal sterilisation (MATS) is a food processing technology that uses long-wavelength microwave energy together with heat to sterilise packaged food.  It retains sensitive nutritional components, along with flavour, texture and appearance.  TCPL MD and CEO Sunil D&rsquo;Souza said, &amp;quot;Tata SmartFoodz is a good strategic fit for us given the nature of its business and it will also allow us to expand our portfolio into the Ready to Eat segment. RTE is a fast-growing segment in India and a sizeable opportunity in the international markets.&amp;quot;  The acquisition will give TCPL access to unique technology and the product portfolio synergizes well with its existing distribution infrastructure both in India and internationally, he said.  We believe Tata Consumer Products is well-positioned to help unlock the market potential of this technology and scale up this business to meet the growing consumer need for wholesome, trusted and convenient food offerings, D&rsquo;Souza added.  Tata SmartFoodz CEO Balark Banarjea said, &amp;quot;Being part of Tata Consumer Products will enable us to strengthen our market presence and scale up the business. It will allow us to leverage Tata Consumer&rsquo;s strength in modern trade and e-commerce channels in India and also its global presence to target key international markets for RTE exports.&amp;quot;  TCPL, earlier known as Tata Global Beverages Ltd, had earlier this year in February had announced to acquire Bengaluru-based Kottaram Agro Foods, engaged in the business of healthy breakfast cereals and millet-based snacks under the trademark Soulfull, for Rs 155.8 crore to expand its product portfolio.  Last month, the company had said it will transfer its tea cafe business &amp;quot;Tata Cha&amp;quot; to group firm IHCL, which operates Taj group of hotels.  TCPL is already operating Tata Starbucks, a 50:50 joint venture with Starbucks Corporation, and operates around 224 stores in 18 cities.  TCPL was formed by merging the consumer products business of Tata Chemicals with Tata Global Beverages and has ambitions to be a leader in the FMCG segment.","Business, Tata Consumer Products, Tata SmartFoodz","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/tata-consumer-products-to-acquire-tata-smartfoodz-for-rs-395-crore_15767681.html

Caustic soda prices were supported by recovery in demand, tightness in supply led by production losses and higher export sales driven by better export realization, the company added.  The capacity utilisation of Caustic soda business improved in Q2FY22 to 86%.

1273,2021-11-13 07:21:30+05:30,Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.,TCS,Q2 Results Review: How top Indian IT companies fared in the quarter gone by,"The pandemic both disrupted business for India&rsquo;s IT companies and opened up new opportunities as the need for digitisation grew globally. Deals, clients and hiring were among the key trends that shaped their performance in the quarter ended September.","India&rsquo;s top IT companies reported one of their best quarters in the three months ended September and are on track to register double-digit growth for the year as demand for digital services continues to rise.  Enterprises globally stepped on the gas on digital transformation as the world moved into a new normal last year after the Covid-19 outbreak. Technology is no longer just about driving cost-efficiency, but also about driving business.  Aviation and hospitality, the two sectors that were worst affected by the pandemic, are investing in contactless check-in facilities as restrictions are lifted. Retailers can no longer afford to ignore online shopping and are investing in IT to drive business. All these are opportunities for the Indian IT services sector.  A look at five key trends that defined the IT results this season.  Deals pipeline The pipeline for contracts was strong in the quarter, although the mega-deals that were prevalent a couple of quarters ago were missing. According to executives, the trend of companies signing medium to large deals will continue.  Tata Consultancy Services won contracts valued at $7.6 billion and Infosys $2.15 billion. Wipro&rsquo;s deal wins stood at $3 billion and HCL Technologies&rsquo; was $2.3 billion. The deals were a mix of small, medium and large contracts. The bulk of the deal pipeline is in the range of $50 million-$200 million,&nbsp;HCL Tech&rsquo;s CEO C Vijayakumar said on an earnings call&nbsp;in October.  &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t call out any significant change to the overall TCV (total contract value) or the pipeline,&rdquo; Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO of TCS, said during an earnings call. &ldquo;For mega-deals, by definition, the frequency is different. And when you look at the pipeline or the TCV without the mega-deal, they are pretty much similar. It&rsquo;s a good mix of both low duration as well as medium- to large-duration deals.&rdquo;  Infosys said the company won 22 deals in the range of $50 million for the quarter and is seeing significant demand in digital and cloud deal space. Infosys won the largest deal in its history with Daimler in December 2020, which took the TCV to $7.13 billion.  &ldquo;We have a good mix of large and medium-size deals,&rdquo; Thierry Delaporte, CEO of Wipro, said during an earnings call. &ldquo;In fact, many mid-size deals and slightly smaller size transformation deals are in the market right now.&rdquo; This trend prevailed for mid-tier tech companies as well. L&amp;amp;amp;T Infotech said it had done many mid-size deals.  Explaining the lack of mega-deals,&nbsp;L&amp;amp;amp;T Infotech CEO Sanjay Jalona said in a recent interaction&nbsp;that&nbsp;customer priorities today are all about dealing with digitisation needs for survival, about becoming more competitive in the marketplace and doing things faster, about the ability to save costs and about creating online systems and kerbside deliveries.  &ldquo;It is not that large deals are completely disappearing. But look at what these large deals typically do &ndash; they are consolidation deals, where you are transitioning from one supplier to another in a defined way,&rdquo; Jalona said. Consolidation is a little lower in priority for them, he said.  Client metrics Another noted improvement in the second quarter was client additions. Apurva Prasad, vice president &ndash; institution research, at Elara Capital, said there was stronger growth in customer metrics as a result of efforts by companies on client mining and additions.  TCS&nbsp;added five clients in the $100 million category and 17 in the $50 million category. In total, the company added 178 clients for the 12 months ended September. &ldquo;Our client additions were very strong across all revenue buckets this quarter, an important measure of the depth of our customer relationships,&rdquo;&nbsp;Gopinathan of TCS&nbsp;said during the earnings call.  Infosys&nbsp;added 131 clients for the year ended September. There were five new clients in the $100 million bucket and two in the $50 million bucket. The revenue contributions from the top 10 clients increased to 19.4 percent in the quarter compared with 18.7 percent a year earlier.  Salil Parekh, CEO of Infosys, said the company&rsquo;s large client base is expanding. &ldquo;There is a huge amount of existing client base that we have, where we see incredible demand. This does not always come into the large deals bucket. It will be in different sizes &ndash; some are large and some are not. But a client that I talked to last week in a meeting with the CIO, we were looking at multiple thousand people expansion at a client where we already have an account base of over $100 million today,&rdquo; he added.  HCL Tech&rsquo;s $100 million clients was up by one and $50 million was up by 12 on a year-on-year basis. The top 20 clients contributed 30.6 percent in revenue, up from 29.9 percent in Q2 of FY21. The company said during the earnings call that its clients are investing heavily in various digital initiatives.  For&nbsp;Wipro, increasing the number of clients was a key focus area since Delaporte took over in July 2020. Wipro added 116 clients, up from 97 a year earlier. The revenue contribution from the top 10 clients increased to 20.1 percent in Q2 of FY22 from 19.6 percent a year ago. The company has increased the number of executives working with key clients globally.  Travel costs up When the pandemic struck in 2020, travel came to a standstill as countries went into lockdown to stop the spread of the virus. Companies suspended business travel and meetings moved online.  More than a year later, with vaccination gaining pace, countries are opening up and business travel is resuming. As a result, travel costs that had dropped as much as 70 percent for companies are slowly climbing. Wipro&rsquo;s Delaporte, who lives in Paris, visited the company headquarters in Bengaluru officially for the first time.  &ldquo;This is my first official visit to the India offices since I took charge in July last year. In the last three days, I met with our senior leaders and teams in India,&rdquo; he said during the earnings call last month. Delaporte said he has just started essential business travel.  This trend is likely to continue and could impact margins. Nilanjan Roy, CFO of Infosys, said that though this might be a headwind, the company has a strong optimisation programme that will help offset these expenses.  Record hiring The&nbsp;top four IT companies increased hiring, with record headcount addition in the&nbsp;quarter. After the top four recruited some 82,000 freshers in FY21, they added 53,964 employees in the quarter ended September, up from 17,076 a year ago.  Gopinathan of TCS had said that this strong demand environment was a &ldquo;once-in-a-decade opportunity.&rdquo;  IT companies, in step, have revised their outlook and are looking at double-digit growth. All these have translated into strong demand for skills like cloud architecture, cybersecurity, full stack development and AI/ML expertise.  TCS plans to sign up 78,000 freshers this year, instead of the 40,000 planned initially. It has already on-boarded 43,000 freshers.&nbsp;Wipro and Infosys have revised their hiring targets&nbsp;to 17,000 and 45,000, respectively, for FY22. HCL Tech plans to hire 22,000 freshers and made a record addition of 11,135 employees in the second quarter.  Attrition, supply chain woes Even as companies ramp up their supply chains by doubling up on freshers, growing attrition is a concern for IT firms. The churn rate at TCS rose to 11.9 percent from 8.6 percent between the last quarters. Wipro and Infosys reported over 20 percent attrition and HCL Tech 15.7 percent. For the previous quarter, the attrition stood at 10-15 percent for these three IT companies.  Attrition may impact the ability of IT companies to take on new projects and execute them.&nbsp;Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation&nbsp;CEO Brian Humphries said the company had to let go of some deals due to supply-side pressures.  L&amp;amp;amp;T Infotech&rsquo;s Jalona said the company would have grown faster if not for the talent crunch in the industry.  However, some executives from the top four IT companies said they are adequately prepared.  &ldquo;Supply-side constraints will not impact our growth, which is a priority for us,&rdquo; Saurabh Govil, chief human resources officer at Wipro, said during the earnings call in October. &ldquo;This is the second quarter where at the company level we&rsquo;ve added more than 10,000 people as a net headcount due to the higher attrition environment. We will continue to look at both freshers and laterals as our strategy. We added two-times more freshers this year and we will further increase it by threefold in FY23.&rdquo;","Result Analysis, Results","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swathi-moorthy-8391/', 'name': 'Swathi Moorthy'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/results/q2-results-review-how-top-indian-it-companies-faredthe-quarter-gone-by_15768821.html
1274,2021-11-14 14:15:10+05:30,Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.,MARUTI,Maruti Suzuki aims to drive in more CNG trims across its product range,"The company, which sold around 1.62 lakh CNG cars last fiscal year, is also counting on the rapid expansion of CNG dispensing outlets across the country to bring in more CNG products.","Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) plans to drive in CNG trims across its product range as it remains bullish over long-term prospects of the segment amid increase in fuel prices and drop in diesel car sales, according to a senior company official.  The company, which sold around 1.62 lakh CNG cars last fiscal year, is also counting on the rapid expansion of CNG dispensing outlets across the country to bring in more CNG products.  Bullish on the expansion of the sales network, the automaker expects its CNG car sales to almost double this fiscal year over 2020-21.  &amp;quot;In 2021-22 we expect to sell around 3 lakh CNG units. It is when many of our models do not have CNG option right now. Out of 15 brands we sell, CNG option is available in just seven models. We are trying to bring CNG options in rest of the portfolio,&rdquo; MSI Senior Executive Director (Sales and Marketing) Shashank Srivastava told&nbsp;PTI in an interaction.  The automaker currently leads the CNG space by a distance in the domestic market with over 85 per cent market share in the segment. Around 1.9 lakh units with CNG powertrain were sold in the country last fiscal year with MSI alone retailing over 1.6 lakh units.  Srivastava noted that with enhanced product range, its CNG sales would further go up in the coming years. He noted that rise in registration and road taxes etc and other regulatory requirements, over the last few years have led to a gradual increase in prices of the cars.  Besides, running costs have gone up due to increase in fuel prices, he added.  &amp;quot;There is an issue which we have raised is the affordability of the entry-level segment. Such cars should be kept in the reach of first time buyers who are upgrading from two-wheelers. If the passenger vehicle industry has to grow we need to support this segment,&amp;quot; Srivastava said.  He noted that this segment is quite price sensitive and therefore if the industry is looking at growth of the overall market, steps need to be taken to keep the acquisition cost of such cars reasonable.  &amp;quot;If we don't do that the industry volumes would suffer...We can't lower the tax part but what we can do is to bring down the running cost of the cars. Indian customers are very sensitive towards running costs of their cars. That is where CNG cars come in, there is so much demand for CNG cars right now,&amp;quot; Srivastava stated.  MSI currently offers CNG trims in Alto, S-presso, WagonR, Eeco, TourS, Ertiga and Super Carry. It is now gearing up to launch a CNG version of the recently introduced all-new Celerio as well.  Srivastava noted that CNG vehicle sales were growing as new cities were getting added to the CNG gas distribution network.  &amp;quot;It has touched 293 cities now from 143 locations three years ago. Next year it may increase to over 330 cities,&amp;quot; he stated.  There used to be only 1,400 filling stations, now the figure has crossed 3,300 mark and is slated to touch 8,700 mark in next 1.5 years, he said.  Srivastava noted that by 2025, the figure is slated to touch 10,000 mark as even the government is supporting CNG because it lowers the country's oil import bill. Over the last few years, MSI has witnessed growth in CNG car sales.  It sold 74,000 units in 2016-17; around 1 lakh units in 2018-19; 1.05 lakh units in 2019-20; and 1.62 lakh units in 2020-21.  &amp;quot;Sales are also going up because people have now realised that factory fit CNG is safe and there is no compromise on performance as well,&amp;quot; Srivastava said.  When asked about re-launch of diesel vehicles, he stated that it may not happen in the near future. He noted that share of diesel vehicles was coming down month after month and is now less than 17 per cent of the overall PV sales.  &amp;quot;In hatchbacks and sedans it is less than 2 per cent. It is just in the mid SUV segment that there is still some traction..there is very less difference in petrol and diesel fuel prices right now so people are shifting towards petrol and CNG cars,&amp;quot; Srivastava said.  The company expects the situation to remain like that in the future as well, he added.  &amp;quot;In 2013-14 diesel cars accounted for 60 per cent of the overall sales, now it has come down to less than 17 per cent. So we don't have much interest in diesel as of now due to this decline in sales,&amp;quot; he noted.  The auto major had discontinued diesel models from its portfolio with the onset of stricter BS-VI emission norms from April last year. MSI's entire model range is currently powered by BS-VI compliant 1 litre, 1.2 litre, 1.5 litre gasoline engines.  On April 26, 2019, MSI Chairman RC Bhargava had announced that the company will phase out all diesel cars from its portfolio with effect from April 1, 2020. He reasoned that small diesel cars would see the maximum impact in terms of pricing with the coming of BS-VI compliant engines.  He, however, at that time had added that if there is a demand for BS-VI diesel cars, the company might go ahead and cater to that demand.","Auto, Business, CNG, Maruti Suzuki India, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/maruti-suzuki-aims-to-drivemore-cng-trims-across-its-product-range_15770581.html

The company was also targeting to makeup the unprecedented annualised cost inflation of Rs 1,300 crore by March 2022 in a combination of price increase and reduction in pack size.  The cost of inflation in 2021-22 for Britannia is more than the cumulative six previous years, company officials said.  &amp;quot;Rural revenue will reach 50 per cent in the next three years for Britannia as the company continues to focus on the rural market,&rdquo; sources told PTI.  The company&rsquo;s revenue from rural segment contribution is already around 35 per cent, analysts estimated.  Britannia has said that the rural market-share gain is 2.5 times in the Q2 period ending September.  In the last few quarters the rural market has been strong and the company continues to stay upbeat at expanding rural distribution.  The company has increased 2,000 rural direct dealers in the last months to 25,000.  It has said the focus states were also showing some positive numbers than national growth.  Meanwhile, the annualised total estimated inflationary pressure which is about Rs 1,300 crore will be recovered by the end of year.  &amp;quot;Till September quarter, five per cent hike had been taken and another 17.5 per cent will be taken in the next two quarters,&rdquo; company sources told PTI.  While a third of this price increase comes into effect at the consumer-end hiking direct price and the remaining two-thirds in reducing pack sizes.  An unprecedented inflation in the price of palm oil of 54 per cent, industrial fuel of 35 per cent and packaging material of 30 per cent led to an overall inflation of 14 per cent during the quarter.  Commodity price inflation has resulted in a lower profit for Britannia in the second quarter of 2021-22.

The Communications vertical is expected to continue to witness growth, driven by 5G and digital transformation related spends. The management also outlined its aspirations to scale up the Enterprise verticals (HLS, Manufacturing, Hi-Tech, BFSI), which should provide comfort on the medium-term growth visibility. The deal win trajectory has accelerated, which the management expects would sustain. The company&rsquo;s large-deal strategy and customer-led approach are showing results. Commentary around EBIT margins was strong, and while the management did not quantify medium-term margin aspirations, it was confident about margin expansion over the medium term. We see near-term headwinds and stretched operating metrics, and expect stable margins in 2HFY22. We expect margin expansion at 80bps over FY21&ndash;23, resulting in a 20% PAT CAGR over FY21&ndash;23E. TECHM's high exposure to the Communications vertical remains a potential opportunity as a broader 5G rollout could lead to a new spending cycle in this space. The company is seeing traction in 5G investments. Moreover, the focus on scaling the Enterprise vertical and driving large deals adds to the medium-term growth visibility.

The miss was due to lower margins in both domestic and Tata steel Europe (TSE) operations. Sentiments on Chinese demand turned negative over last quarter. Contrary to historical trend of China pushing volumes in the exports market at unfeasible prices levels in wake of soft domestic demand, the flow of Chinese steel exports has been significantly contained this time with stringent curbs on production. Nonetheless, Chinese steel prices came under pressure with fall of ~15% over last couple of months due to lower iron ore prices and weak demand. As expected, margins were expected to soften due to unsustainable coking coal prices. Having said that, FY23e margins would average out at significantly above historical averages by ~35-40% due to structural withdrawal of Chinese supplies and better outlook on demand.

The Mumbai-based company, which was one of the first companies to develop a fully electric commercial vehicle on its own, is preparing to launch its first electric truck, which, according to a company official, &lsquo;will be launched soon&rsquo;. Tata Motors is already the leader in the electric passenger vehicle segment with a share of more than 70 percent.  Speaking to Moneycontrol, Girish Wagh, executive director, Tata Motors said, &ldquo;We are working in a very modular manner. While we have a product plan at the product tonnage in the background, we have an aggregate strategy which is about battery packs, motors and axles. All the work we are doing for IC (internal combustion) engines we are keeping it flexible for introduction of alternate fuels and electric. So, if tomorrow electrification is required for a vehicle, we don&rsquo;t need to change the basic platform.&rdquo;  Wagh added that Tata Motors is looking to introduce an electric vehicle that will cater to the last mile segment. He, however, did not provide a timeline of the launch. Rival Ashok Leyland is preparing to launch the electric version of the 150 km drive range Dost and Bada Dost in the market. Both vehicles are mini trucks used in intra-city operations. A number of start-ups have introduced small electric load carrying commercial vehicles since the past one year and several more are in the pipeline.  The Tata Group company, which is the leader in the electric bus segment having the largest share of electric bus number in operation in India, is working on a platform for the future that will be born electric. This essentially means that the CV models will be developed specifically for electric application. The upcoming electric mini truck, however, will be a flexible platform model.  Tata Motors passenger vehicle division is working on a similar strategy wherein the development of born-electric platform is underway. As the vehicle is designed to be destined as an EV, the cost of development and vehicle performance is vastly different than a conventional platform development.  When asked if Tata Motors will look at born electric platform, Wagh said, &ldquo;Yes, even in CVs it can make sense. That is also something we will start looking at because finally we have to see when the transition is going to happen. Some of the new platforms we will work on will essentially have electric from day one.&rdquo;  Besides electric, Tata Motors is also working on hydrogen fuel technology and the debut of this model will happen after two years. The company has committed to deliver 15 fuel-cell buses to Indian Oil Corporation.  &ldquo;We are studying the entire market because in the long term all vehicles will be electric. We are keeping a track for the entire range for battery electric and fuel cell because these are the two base technologies. Once we are ready with these, we can deploy them in various tonnage nodes,&rdquo; Wagh added.","Auto, Business, Tata Motors, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/swaraj-baggonkar-6838/', 'name': 'Swaraj Baggonkar'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/tata-motors-workingborn-electricflexi-vehicle-platforms-for-future_15784201.html
1282,2021-11-18 10:48:54+05:30,Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.,MARUTI,No festive cheer for auto sector as sales slump to decade low,"At 2.09 million, registrations of new vehicles during the festive days was 18 percent lower than the same period FY21 and nearly 21 percent lower than FY20.","The 42-day festive period was the worst in a decade for the automotive sector thanks to the semiconductor supply crunch and poor demand for two-wheelers.  According to retail sales data supplied by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA), 2.09 million registrations of new vehicles during the festive days was 18 percent lower than the same period FY21 and nearly 21 percent lower than FY20.  The 42-day period includes Navratri, Dussehra and Diwali. The data does not include registrations done in Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Lakshadweep and Telangana. Typically, the festive days generate 30-40 percent of the yearly volumes.  Vinkesh Gulati, President, FADA said, &ldquo;We have witnessed the worst festive season in the last decade.&rdquo;  Passenger vehicle (car, SUV and van) volumes dipped 26 percent to 324,542 units compared to FY21. Subdued supplies from carmakers was the single biggest problem for the industry rather than retail demand.  &ldquo;Semiconductor shortage which was already a full-blown crisis showed its true colours when in spite of a healthy demand, we could not cater to customer&rsquo;s needs as SUV, compact SUV and luxury categories witnessed huge shortage of vehicles. On the other hand, entry level cars saw subdued demand as customers in this category continued to conserve money due to their family&rsquo;s healthcare needs,&rdquo; Gulati added.  Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, MG Motor, Renault, Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra, Tata Motors struggled to produce as per schedule due to the chip shortage. As per estimates the industry is sitting on pending bookings of 550,000 units, including 250,000 bookings of Maruti Suzuki and more than 200,000 of Tata Motors and Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra.  Waiting period on several models have crossed 6 months while in the case of the newly-launched Mahindra XUV700 the waiting period is one year on certain variants. The average inventory for the PV sector remained low at 10-15 days as against the usual 35-40 days.  Two-wheeler registrations dipped 18 percent to 1.57 million units during the festive period as against the same period in FY21. The average inventory for the two-wheeler sector was higher at 40-45 days compared to its usual 35-40 days. Poor demand from the rural pockets was one of the primary reasons behind the fall in sales of two-wheelers.  &ldquo;The two-wheeler category continues to face the brunt of low sales with the entry level category being the biggest spoilsport. The rural distress in retails coupled with frequent price hikes, triple digit fuel prices and customers conserving funds for healthcare emergencies kept the demand low. In fact, walk-in&rsquo;s and customer inquiries were also ultra-lean during the said period,&rdquo; Gulati added.  Commercial vehicles (CV) and three-wheeler segment, bucked the broader trend to post a growth in sales although the comparison was made on a low base. CVs recorded nearly 10 percent growth in volumes to 77,066 units as compared to FY21 but lower than FY20 volumes.  Three-wheeler volumes marked a jump of 53 percent to 52,802 units compared to FY21 but still lower by 39 percent when compared to FY20. The growth in volumes was powered by demand for electric three-wheelers.  &ldquo;Even though the festive period is now over, there is still a huge backlog of order in the PV segment. If PV makers are able to realign supply with demand, we can still see a good year end retail. FADA requests two-wheeler makers to rationalise inventory. It also urges to roll out attractive schemes for customers so that demand, especially in the entry level category can be revived,&rdquo; Gulati added.","Auto, Business, FADA, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/no-festive-cheer-for-auto-sector-as-sales-slump-to-decade-low_15787161.html

We also draw comfort from improving management commentary on continued growth momentum in the IT Services business. Sustainable demand momentum for Cloud and Digital Engineering benefits HCLT, given its large presence within IMS and ER&amp;amp;amp;D and continued investments in capabilities. Strong headcount additions and deal wins reflects the management's confidence on a sustainable growth momentum. We continue to see potential in HCLT's Products and Platforms business. While, the recent departure of the head of Products has elevated concerns on business recovery. However, we don't see a meaningful risk of a further hit from this event, our sensitivity analysis (Exhibit 7) suggests limited impact on EPS even in a bear case (4% decline in revenue for the Products and Platforms business in FY23E would lead to a 2.6% drag on our EPS estimate). On a combined basis, HCLT should deliver USD revenue growth of 13.1% over FY21-23E. We expect EBIT margin to stabilize at 20% in FY23E, which should help it deliver 14.3% PAT CAGR over FY21-23E. HCLT's recent revision in payout policy (at least 75% of net income, up from 50%) over FY22-26 is a positive. A higher payout reflects a strategic shift to focus on organic growth and limit inorganic investments to bolt-on and capability based acquisitions (v/s large revenue accretive acquisitions). We maintain our Buy rating as we expect traction in the Services business in 2HFY22E and FY23E, driven by higher IMS/Cloud-focused deals.  Outlook Given its deep capabilities in IMS and strategic partnerships, investments in Cloud, and Digital capabilities, we expect HCLT to emerge stronger on the back of an expected increase in enterprise demand for these services.

Tata Steel achieved a new highest ever quarterly consolidated EBITDA of Rs. 164.5 billion, which reflects a margin of 27.3%. The consolidated profit after tax was also one of the highest at Rs. 123.6 billion with a net profit margin of 20.5%. During the quarter, Tata steel standalone business deliveries improved 10.4 % QoQ to 4.58 mn tons, While consolidated front steel production fell by 1.4% to 7.77 mn tons, steel deliveries increased by 3.9% to 7.39 mn tons in Q2 FY22 over Q1 FY22. As compared with Q2 FY21, the steel production is higher by 7.2% but deliveries are lower by 6.8%, despite market demand contraction amidst seasonal weakness, and this is a testament to their strong customer relationships and a superior distribution network. Sales volume to the Automotive segment increased by 18% QoQ despite semiconductor shortage driven weakness in the sector.  Outlook After a strong performance in H1FY22, we expect the rest of the year to be stronger for Tata Steel standalone operations. Domestic steel prices are at a discount to import parity prices allowing companies to push through price hikes. Iron ore integration in the domestic operations enables the company to capture the increase in steel prices in profits. European operations are also expected to remain profitable with an improvement in spreads which lead to further fall in net debt over FY22-FY24 even though Tata Steel will continue to pursue growth capex in India. Hence, we reiterate our BUY rating on the stock with target price of Rs. 1,776.

The scrappage unit which is owned by Maruti Suzuki Toyotsu India (MSTI), a joint venture between Maruti Suzuki and Toyota Tsusho Group, is one of the first in the country. The facility which can process one car in 200 minutes, is built at a cost of Rs 44 crore.  Called as the &lsquo;Voluntary Vehicle Fleet Modernisation Programme&rsquo; the scrappage scheme, launched by the Government of India on August 13, is expected to generate investments of Rs 10,000 crore. The policy is aimed at incentivising owners of old and polluting vehicles to take them off the road.  After the procurement from dealerships and individuals the end of life vehicles will reach the MSTI campus in the second leg of the journey. After confirming the documentation and inspection, the car is sent for pre-treatment and de-pollution to ensure zero discharge.  Thereafter the vehicle is dismantled and sent for processing and segregation of scrap before the steel is sold to steel mills and smelters. MSTI claims that there will can be scrap recovery of up to 95 percent.  The customer will get a direct payment in his bank account along with a vehicle destruction certificate. According to Nitin Gadkari, Minister or Road Transport and Highways scrappage policy likely lead to a cut in raw material costs by around 40 percent.  &ldquo;I have asked OEMs to give Rs 1-1.5 lakh benefit to the buyer who has the scrappage certificate. I have taken the decisions that were possible at my level. We are going to discuss this with the Finance Ministry again, to think about ways to facilitate this. Can we give more concessions? We have planned something but we cannot discuss that at the moment. We are requesting the Finance Ministry, states and GST council to see if we can get more incentives,&rdquo; Gadkari said after inaugurating the scrapping facility.  Other automakers are also warming up to the idea of setting up such scrapping centres. Tata Motors, India&rsquo;s third largest carmaker and the biggest commercial vehicle maker, is planning to set up vehicle scrappage centres under a franchise agreement and the first such centre is expected to be operational in the first quarter of next year.","Auto, Business, Maruti Suzuki, Technology","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/maruti-toyota-inaugurate-vehicle-scrapping-unitnoida_15803501.html

Cigarette volumes for ITC and even other players globally have been on a declining trend, given the increased health consciousness among consumers over the last decade. With the government having recently (Oct'21) set up an expert panel tasked with preparing a comprehensive tax policy proposal for all forms of tobacco from a public health perspective, the overhang of a policy change that may affect cigarette volumes remains on the stock. The rumored demerger of ITC Infotech, even at INR200-250b, is only 6-8% of ITC's current market capitalization and is partly factored in the price already. In our opinion, it does not portend demerger of other FMCG or the Hotels business in the near term, nor does it reduce the dependence on its Cigarette EBIT.

Stating the Sputnik Light is the Component 1 of the Gam-COVID-Vac Combined Vector Vaccine (Sputnik V), P Madhavi, the Director-Regulatory Affairs at Dr Reddy&rsquo;s Laboratories, proposed to use batches of the vaccine manufactured at Hetero Biopharma Limited, Telangana, and at its loan license facility at Shilpa Biologicals Private Limited in Karnataka for the phase-3 trial.  Sputnik Light has not yet received emergency use authorisation from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI).  &amp;quot;Seeking your permission to conduct 'a phase-3 randomized, open-label three-arm, multi-centre, clinical study in parallel assignment to evaluate immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of Sputnik Light vector vaccine against COVID-19 in healthy Indian subjects,&rdquo; a source quoted Madhavi as having said in the application.  Recently, Serum Institute of India sought from DCGI approval for Covishield as a booster dose citing adequate stock of the vaccine in the country and a demand for a booster shot due to the emergence of new coronavirus variants.  In an application to the DCGI, Prakash Kumar Singh, the Director, Government and Regulatory Affairs at Serum Institute cited that the UK&rsquo;s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has already approved the booster dose of AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine.  The INSACOG, in its bulletin dated November 29, recommended a booster dose of COVID-19 vaccines for those above 40 years with preference to high-risk and high-exposure populations.  However, later it said their recommendation was not for the national immunisation programme as many more scientific experiments are required to assess its impact.  Justifying the need for a booster dose six months after the second dose for all adult population instead of the high-risk population, Madhavi in the application said, &amp;quot;After getting vaccinated against COVID-19, protection against the virus may decrease over time and be less effective against the Delta variant.&rdquo;  &amp;quot;Declining VNA titers may herald significant declines in effectiveness against severe disease. The recent emergence of highly transmissible variants of SARS-CoV-2 has led to considerations for booster doses to enhance immunity and provide sustained protection from COVID-19.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Emerging evidence shows that among healthcare and other frontline workers, vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 decreases rapidly due to the combination of waning immunity and the greater exposure to virus including variants,&rdquo; the source quoted Madhavi as having stated in the application.  A booster dose of COVID-19 vaccines administered months after primary vaccination is expected to augment immunity against the virus, including neutralizing capacity against the variants of concern, she said.  The benefits of booster dose are expected to be seen in the entire adult population and not just elderly or high-risk cases.  Both Pfizer and Moderna had conducted their booster dose studies in the overall adult population demonstrating an increase in immunogenicity titres post-administration of the booster dose, Madhavi said.  &amp;quot;We intend to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of Sputnik Light vector vaccine when administered at least six months after primary vaccination with Covaxin or Covishield,&rdquo; she said in the application.  Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya had recently informed the Lok Sabha that the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization and the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 are deliberating and considering scientific evidence for administering booster doses.","Business, coronavirus, COVID-19 vaccine booster, DGCI, Dr Reddys Laboratories, Sputnik Light","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/dr-reddy39s-laboratories-seeks-dcgi39s-nod-for-phase-3-trialsputnik-light-as-booster-dose_15844901.html

The management remains confident about this growth trajectory and mentioned six factors that would drive growth &ndash; demand, capability, talent, sales and marketing, team, and operational resilience. The company continues to expect faster growth than the industry average growth of 9%+ as digital transformation led demand fuels client spending. It sees talent as the only limiting factor in its aspiration to double revenues to USD4b over the next few years. LTI&rsquo;s large-deal pipeline (new only) of USD2.07b v/s USD1.9b in FY21 (USD1.2b excluding mega deals) was relatively modest, but primarily consisted of smaller deals &ndash; unlike the three mega deals (one converted) that inflated FY21 figures. 44% of this large deal pipeline is contributed by new logos. It also mentioned the pipeline including renewals is meaningfully larger. The company reiterated its stance to maintain net margins at 14&ndash;15% as it continues to focus on reinvesting to capture incremental market share rather than the margin uptick. We see this as an indication of the company&rsquo;s willingness to absorb pricing pressure, unlike peer commentary on price hikes. Although LTI has hired a record number of employees recently, it continues to see the supply side as a concern over the near term. LTI expects the situation to ease over the next 4&ndash;6 quarters.

This shift in the business model should lead to a substantial increase (5% revenue v/s 3% historically) in the tech budgets of enterprise clients, adding 5-6% incremental growth for the industry. Growth in the cloud would anchor this phase of technology spending, which would see a mid to high teen growth rate.

Its 13 new hospitals are now nearing maturity, contributing to its growth and profitability. At the same time, AHEL is rapidly strengthening its adjacencies in healthcare services through the Apollo 24|7 platform, which has an unpatrolled reach and turnaround time, powered by its expansive network of 4,300 retail pharmacy stores. We expect its omni-channel differentiated factor to be the preferred mode for online pharmacy going forward, enabling AHEL to garner a ~14% market share in e-pharmacy over the next five years. Additionally, the improving profitability and expansion of Apollo Health And Lifestyle Limited (AHLL) will act as another growth lever, with much promise of growth in this highly efficient business in the future.

We believe that rural slowdown and inflation challenges are transitory and structural story is intact as 1) More than 75% of business is gaining share which is at a decade high 2) HFD segment is likely to emerge as a key driver of growth led by distribution led gains and small packs 4) sustained innovation across categories and launch of D2C platforms for Lakme, Simple, Dermalogica and Love Beauty &amp;amp;amp; Planet and 5) distribution gains from strategies like WIMI and SHIKHAR.

The average cost of debt for the metro is currently 9-9.5%. This will entail annual savings of ~Rs3bn, leading to lower losses at Hyderabad Metro. Further, HM's ridership has touched 250k per day recently - up from ~190k in Q2FY22. However, it still remains below pre-Covid levels of 400k. Apart from the refinancing of the HM loan, LT is looking at various other options such as the sale of developed real estate, stake sale in the metro, claims/grant from the Telangana government to minimize the losses.  Outlook We reiterate Buy and raise the TP to Rs2,320 (Dec'22E) from Rs2,200, as we factor in the higher valuation of IT subsidiaries, in line with Emkay's valuation of LT Infotech and Mindtree.

In addition, LTFH will also be entitled to excess cash (INR5-7b) in LTIM&rsquo;s books until the completion of this divestment/acquisition. Including the excess cash (except the minimum cash requirement of INR0.5-1b) that LTFH is entitled to, the total sale consideration would be INR37-39b (4.6-4.8% of current AUM). HSBC AMC would merge its existing Asset Management business (Sep&rsquo;21 AUM of INR117b) with that of LTMF (Sep&rsquo;21 AUM of INR803b). Subject to all regulatory approvals, LTFH expects this transaction to be completed within the next 9-12 months (i.e. by Dec&rsquo;22). -Consequent to its last rights issue in Feb&rsquo;21, wherein LTFH raised INR30b, its capital adequacy is at a healthy ~25% (Tier I: 20%). While the sale of the Asset Management business will take another 9-12 months to be consummated, we believe LTFH will utilize the proceeds primarily for risk capital (improving the provisioning cover) and only a small portion for growth capital (given its already healthy capital adequacy). Alternatively, part of the gains from this transaction could also be paid out as dividends. As highlighted earlier, LTFH is near the bottom in terms of consolidation of its loan book and should start exhibiting loan growth in 2HFY22E. NPA recognition of a large Real Estate account in 2QFY22 has removed an overhang of potential asset quality stress and will allow LTFH to work towards its resolution.
